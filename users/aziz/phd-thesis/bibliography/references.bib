  abstract = {High-precision modeling of systems is one of the main areas of industrial data analysis. Models of systems, their digital twins, are used to predict their behavior under various conditions. We have developed several models of a storage system using machine learning-based generative models. The system consists of several components: hard disk drive (HDD) and solid-state drive (SSD) storage pools with different RAID schemes and cache. Each storage component is represented by a probabilistic model that describes the probability distribution of the component performance in terms of IOPS and latency, depending on their configuration and external data load parameters. The results of the experiments demonstrate the errors of 4-10 \% for IOPS and 3-16 \% for latency predictions depending on the components and models of the system. The predictions show up to 0.99 Pearson correlation with Little's law, which can be used for unsupervised reliability checks of the models. In addition, we present novel data sets that can be used for benchmarking regression algorithms, conditional generative models, and uncertainty estimation methods in machine learning.},

  abstract = {Modification of physical properties of materials and design of materials with on-demand characteristics is at the heart of modern technology. Rare application relies on pure materials—most devices and technologies require careful design of materials properties through alloying, creating heterostructures of composites, or controllable introduction of defects. At the same time, such designer materials are notoriously difficult to model. Thus, it is very tempting to apply machine learning methods to such systems. Unfortunately, there is only a handful of machine learning-friendly material databases available these days. We develop a platform for easy implementation of machine learning techniques to materials design and populate it with datasets on pristine and defected materials. Here we introduce the 2D Material Defect (2DMD) datasets that include defect properties of represented 2D materials such as MoS2, WSe2, hBN, GaSe, InSe, and black phosphorous, calculated using DFT. Our study provides a data-driven physical understanding of complex behaviors of defect properties in 2D materials, holding promise for a guide to the development of efficient machine learning models. In addition, with the increasing enrollment of datasets, our database could provide a platform for designing materials with predetermined properties.},

  abstract = {Two-dimensional materials offer a promising platform for the next generation of (opto-) electronic devices and other high technology applications. One of the most exciting characteristics of 2D crystals is the ability to tune their properties via controllable introduction of defects. However, the search space for such structures is enormous, and ab-initio computations prohibitively expensive. We propose a machine learning approach for rapid estimation of the properties of 2D material given the lattice structure and defect configuration. The method suggests a way to represent configuration of 2D materials with defects that allows a neural network to train quickly and accurately. We compare our methodology with the state-of-the-art approaches and demonstrate at least 3.7 times energy prediction error drop. Also, our approach is an order of magnitude more resource-efficient than its contenders both for the training and inference part.},

Due to the cost and time limitations of measuring the actual execution time of each application on SSDs, it is di cult for users to determine the best SSD for their most commonly used applications. In this paper, we propose a framework of estimating the execution time of an application IO trace (i.e., a query IO trace) on a target SSD without its real execution. Our framework is based on the observation that if two IO traces are similar in their IO behavior, their execution times tend to be similar when executed on the same SSD. e performance of the framework is evaluated through extensive experiments on real applications. e results show that our framework is accurate in estimating the execution time of an IO trace on SSDs.},

As the complexity of SSD architecture increases, it is necessary to use a systematic methodology for architecture design. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology to explore the design space of an SSD based on a genetic algorithm at the early design stage. The key technical challenge in the design space exploration (DSE) is fast and accurate performance estimation or fitness evaluation in the genetic algorithm. To tackle this challenge, we propose two performance estimation methods. One is based on the scheduling of the task graph abstracted from the firmware and the other one is based on a neural network (NN) regression model. While the NN-based method is faster, the accuracy of the NN-based method depends on the training data set that consists of hardware configurations and performance. The scheduling-based performance estimator is used to generate the training data set fast. The viability of the proposed methodology is confirmed by comparison with a state-of-the-art SSD simulator in terms of accuracy and speed for design space exploration.},

However, current server architects cannot achieve the full performance potential of commodity SSDs, as SSDs are complex devices designed for specific goals (e.g., latency, throughput, endurance, cost) with their internal mechanisms undisclosed to users. In this article, we propose SSDcheck, a novel SSD performance model to extract various internal mechanisms and predict the latency of next access to commodity black-box SSDs. We identify key performance-critical features (e.g., garbage collection, write buffering) and find their parameters (i.e., size, threshold) from each SSD by using our novel diagnosis code snippets. Then, SSDcheck constructs a performance model for a target SSD and dynamically manages the model to predict the latency of the next access. In addition, SSDcheck extracts and provides other useful internal mechanisms (e.g., fetch unit in multi-queue SSDs, background tasks triggering idle-time interval) for the storage system to fully exploit SSDs. By using those useful features and the performance model, we propose multiple practical use cases. Our evaluations show that SSDcheck’s performance model is highly accurate, and proposed use cases achieve significant performance improvement in various scenarios.},

An accurate SSD performance model will provide the important research tools for exploring the design space of flash-based storage systems. While many HDD performance models have been developed, architectural differences prevent these models from being effective for SSDs, mostly because their designs cannot accurately account for many unique SSD characteristics (e.g., low latencies, slow updates, and expensive erases). In this paper, we utilize the black-box modeling technique to analyze and evaluate SSD performance, including latency, bandwidth, and throughput. Such an approach is appealing because it requires minimal a priori information about SSDs. We construct and evaluate our models on three commercial SSDs.

  abstract = {Increasing usage of Solid-State Drives (SSDs) has greatly boosted the performance of storage backends. SSDs perform many internal processes such as out-of-place writes, wear-leveling, and garbage collection. These operations are complex and not well documented which make it difficult to create accurate SSD simulators. Our survey indicates that aside from complex configuration, available SSD simulators do not support both sync and discard requests. Past performance models also ignore the long term effect of I/O requests on SSD performance, which has been demonstrated to be significant. In this paper, we utilize a methodology based on machine learning that extracts history-aware features at low cost to train SSD performance models that predict request response times. A key goal of our work is to achieve real-time or near-real time feature extraction and to achieve practical training times so our work can be considered as part of solutions that perform online or periodical characterization such as adaptive storage algorithms. Thus, we extract features from individual read, write, sync, and discard I/O requests and use structures such as exponentially decaying counters to track past activity using O(1) memory and processing cost. To make our methodology accessible and usable in real-world online scenarios, we focus on machine learning models that can be trained quickly on a single machine. To massively reduce processing and memory cost, we utilize feature selection to reduce feature count by up to 63\%, allowing a feature extraction rate of 313,000 requests per second using a single thread. Our dataset contains 580M requests taken from 35 workloads. We experiment with three families of machine learning models, a) decision trees, b) ensemble methods utilizing decision trees, and c) Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN). Based on these experiments, FNN achieves an average R2 score of 0.72 compared to 0.61 and 0.45 for the Random Forest and Bagging, respectively, where R2 ∈ (− inf, 1) of 1 indicates a perfect fit. However, while the random forest model has lower accuracy, it uses general processing hardware and can be trained much faster, making it viable for use in online scenarios.},

  abstract = {As an emerging technology in the era of Industry 4.0, digital twin is gaining unprecedented attention because of its promise to further optimize process design, quality control, health monitoring, decision and policy making, and more, by comprehensively modeling the physical world as a group of interconnected digital models. In a two-part series of papers, we examine the fundamental role of different modeling techniques, twinning enabling technologies, and uncertainty quantification and optimization methods commonly used in digital twins. This second paper presents a literature review of key enabling technologies of digital twins, with an emphasis on uncertainty quantification, optimization methods, open source datasets and tools, major findings, challenges, and future directions. Discussions focus on current methods of uncertainty quantification and optimization and how they are applied in different dimensions of a digital twin. Additionally, this paper presents a case study where a battery digital twin is constructed and tested to illustrate some of the modeling and twinning methods reviewed in this two-part review. Code and preprocessed data for generating all the results and figures presented in the case study are available on GitHub.},

We demonstrate how typical evaluation metrics for speech enhancement and blind source separation can fail to accurately measure the perceived effect of a wide variety of distortions. As an alternative, we propose adapting the Fre´chet Inception Distance (FID) metric used to evaluate generative image models to the audio domain. FAD is validated using a wide variety of artificial distortions and is compared to the signal based metrics signal to distortion ratio (SDR), cosine distance, and magnitude L2 distance. We show that, with a correlation coefficient of 0.52, FAD correlates more closely with human perception than either SDR, cosine distance or magnitude L2 distance, with correlation coefficients of 0.39, −0.15 and −0.01 respectively.},

  abstract = {The new wave of successful generative models in machine learning has increased the interest in deep learning driven de novo drug design. However, assessing the performance of such generative models is notoriously difficult. Metrics that are typically used to assess the performance of such generative models are the percentage of chemically valid molecules or the similarity to real molecules in terms of particular descriptors, such as the partition coefficient (logP) or druglikeness. However, method comparison is difficult because of the inconsistent use of evaluation metrics, the necessity for multiple metrics, and the fact that some of these measures can easily be tricked by simple rule-based systems. We propose a novel distance measure between two sets of molecules, called Fr\textbackslash 'echet ChemNet distance (FCD), that can be used as an evaluation metric for generative models. The FCD is similar to a recently established performance metric for comparing image generation methods, the Fr\textbackslash 'echet Inception Distance (FID). Whereas the FID uses one of the hidden layers of InceptionNet, the FCD utilizes the penultimate layer of a deep neural network called ChemNet, which was trained to predict drug activities. Thus, the FCD metric takes into account chemically and biologically relevant information about molecules, and also measures the diversity of the set via the distribution of generated molecules. The FCD's advantage over previous metrics is that it can detect if generated molecules are a) diverse and have similar b) chemical and c) biological properties as real molecules. We further provide an easy-to-use implementation that only requires the SMILES representation of the generated molecules as input to calculate the FCD. Implementations are available at: https://www.github.com/bioinf-jku/FCD},

Following their successful application in image processing and representation learning, an important next step is to consider videos. Learning generative models of video is a much harder task, requiring a model to capture the temporal dynamics of a scene, in addition to the visual presentation of objects. While recent generative models of video have had some success, current progress is hampered by the lack of qualitative metrics that consider visual quality, temporal coherence, and diversity of samples. To this extent we propose Fréchet Video Distance (FVD), a new metric for generative models of video based on FID. We contribute a large-scale human study, which confirms that FVD correlates well with qualitative human judgment of generated videos.},

	abstract = {The need for reliable and cost-effective data storage grows as digital information becomes increasingly ubiquitous. Archival systems must store valuable data for years while adapting to changing user needs, capacity, and performance requirements. Storage devices differ in terms of performance, capacity, reliability, acquisition cost, power consumption, and the rates at which their features change over time. As a result, choosing the best storage technology to use for an archive has become increasingly challenging with the proliferation of new technologies alongside existing ones. We have designed a simulator that models the capacity, performance, acquisition cost, and power cost of an archival system using the characteristics of the drives and media that comprise it. We simulate and compare four storage technologies that exhibit different cost and performance characteristics: tape, optical disc, hard disk, and NAND flash SSD. We evaluate the total cost of ownership for each storage technology within an archival system, and we explore the effect that prospective technological advancements and growth rates over time may have on the relative cost and viability of each storage technology for archival systems. We show that the lifecycle and upgrade cost of drives are significant cost factors for removable media archives. We observe that increasing performance requires adding more drives to an archival system, and the cost of each drive dominates the cost to increase performance. We compare trends in storage technologies to suggest developments that could minimize the long-term total cost of ownership for archival systems. We show that hard disks and flash could become cost-competitive with tape-based archives by adopting new designs to minimize infrastructure and electricity costs.},

In this paper, we take our previous work one step further and present an in-depth analysis of the key features of future big data storage services for both unstructured and semi-structured data, and discuss how such services should be constructed and deployed. We also explain how different technologies can be combined to provide a single, highly scalable, efficient and performance-aware big data storage system. We especially focus on the issues of data de-duplication for enterprises and private organisations. This research is particularly valuable for inexperienced solution providers like universities and research organisations, and will allow them to swiftly set up their own big data storage services.},

  abstract = {The emerging interlaced magnetic recording (IMR) technology achieves a higher areal density for hard disk drive (HDD) over the conventional magnetic recording (CMR) technology. IMR-based HDD interlaces top tracks and bottom tracks, where each bottom track is overlapped with two neighboring top tracks. Thus, top tracks can be updated without restraint, whereas bottom tracks can be updated by the time-consuming read-modify-write (RMW) or other novel update strategy. Therefore, the layout of the tracks between the IMR-based HDD and the CMR-based HDD is much different. Unfortunately, there has been no related disk simulator and product available to the public, which motivates us to develop an open-source IMR disk simulator to provide a platform for further research. We implement the first public IMR disk simulator, called IMRSim, as a block device driver in the Linux kernel, simulating the interlaced tracks and implementing many state-of-the-art data placement strategies. IMRSim is built on the actual CMR-based HDD to precisely simulate the I/O performance of IMR drives. While I/O operations in CMR-based HDD are easy to visualize, update strategy and multi-stage allocation strategy in IMR are inherently dynamic. Therefore, we further graphically demonstrate how IMRSim processes I/O requests in the visualization mode. We release IMRSim as an open-source IMR disk simulation tool and hope to attract more scholars into related research on IMR technology.},

  abstract = {Existing solid state drive (SSD) simulators unfortunately lack hardware and/or software architecture models. Consequently, they are far from capturing the critical features of contemporary SSD devices. More importantly, while the performance of modern systems that adopt SSDs can vary based on their numerous internal design parameters and storage-level configurations, a full system simulation with traditional SSD models often requires unreasonably long runtimes and excessive computational resources. In this work, we propose SimpleSSD, a highfidelity simulator that models all detailed characteristics of hardware and software, while simplifying the nondescript features of storage internals. In contrast to existing SSD simulators, SimpleSSD can easily be integrated into publicly-available full system simulators. In addition, it can accommodate a complete storage stack and evaluate the performance of SSDs along with diverse memory technologies and microarchitectures. Thus, it facilitates simulations that explore the full design space at different levels of system abstraction.},

abstract = {Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) excel at creating realistic images with complex models for which maximum likelihood is infeasible. However, the convergence of GAN training has still not been proved. We propose a two time-scale update rule (TTUR) for training GANs with stochastic gradient descent on arbitrary GAN loss functions. TTUR has an individual learning rate for both the discriminator and the generator. Using the theory of stochastic approximation, we prove that the TTUR converges under mild assumptions to a stationary local Nash equilibrium. The convergence carries over to the popular Adam optimization, for which we prove that it follows the dynamics of a heavy ball with friction and thus prefers flat minima in the objective landscape. For the evaluation of the performance of GANs at image generation, we introduce the 'Fr\'{e}chet Inception Distance" (FID) which captures the similarity of generated images to real ones better than the Inception Score. In experiments, TTUR improves learning for DCGANs and Improved Wasserstein GANs (WGAN-GP) outperforming conventional GAN training on CelebA, CIFAR-10, SVHN, LSUN Bedrooms, and the One Billion Word Benchmark.},

ABSTRACT={Multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs) are a new class of alloys that consist of many principal elements randomly distributed on a crystal lattice. The random presence of many elements lends large variations in the point defect formation and migration energies even within a given alloy composition. Compounded by the fact that there could be exponentially large number of MPEA compositions, there is a major computational challenge to capture complete point-defect energy phase-space in MPEAs. In this work, we present a machine learning based framework in which the point defect energies in MPEAs are predicted from a database of their constituent binary alloys. We demonstrate predictions of vacancy migration and formation energies in face centered cubic ternary, quaternary and quinary alloys in Ni-Fe-Cr-Co-Cu system. A key benefit of building this framework based on the database of binary alloys is that it enables defect-energy predictions in alloy compositions that may be unearthed in future. Furthermore, the methodology enables identifying the impact of a given alloying element on the defect energies thereby enabling design of alloys with tailored defect properties.}

	abstract = {We present a graph neural network modeling approach that fully automates the prediction of the {DFT}-relaxed vacancy formation enthalpy of any crystallographic site from its {DFT}-relaxed host structure. Applicable to arbitrary structures with an accuracy limited principally by the amount/diversity of the data on which it is trained, this model accelerates the screening of vacancy defects by many orders of magnitude by replacing the {DFT} supercell relaxations required for each symmetrically unique crystal site. It can thus be used off-the-shelf to rapidly screen 10,000s of crystal structures (which can contain millions of unique defects) from existing databases of {DFT}-relaxed crystal structures. This modeling approach therefore provides a significant screening and discovery capability for a plethora of applications in which vacancy defects are the primary driver of a material's utility. For example, by high-throughput screening the Materials Project's metal oxides, we rapidly "re-discover" and identify new high potential candidate materials for hydrogen generation via solar thermochemical water splitting and energy storage, for {CO}2 conversion via reverse water gas shift chemical looping, and for cathodes in solid oxide fuel cells. Thermodynamic modeling on the basis of the high-throughput screening results allows us to connect the predicted defect energies to high temperature process conditions relevant to the different application areas, and we extract the reduction entropies as an additional selection criterion for high-performance materials. Further model development and accumulation of additional training data will only serve to expand the significant utility of this generalizable defect model to solving materials discovery problems in clean energy applications and beyond.},

Building on recent theoretical analyses of deep ResNets at initialization, we propose a simple set of analysis tools to characterize signal propagation on the forward pass, and leverage these tools to design highly performant ResNets without activation normalization layers. Crucial to our success is an adapted version of the recently proposed Weight Standardization. Our analysis tools show how this technique preserves the signal in networks with ReLU or Swish activation functions by ensuring that the per-channel activation means do not grow with depth. Across a range of FLOP budgets, our networks attain performance competitive with the state-of-the-art EfficientNets on ImageNet.},

  abstract = {By decomposing the image formation process into a sequential application of denoising autoencoders, diffusion models (DMs) achieve state-of-the-art synthesis results on image data and beyond. Additionally, their formulation allows for a guiding mechanism to control the image generation process without retraining. However, since these models typically operate directly in pixel space, optimization of powerful DMs often consumes hundreds of GPU days and inference is expensive due to sequential evaluations. To enable DM training on limited computational resources while retaining their quality and flexibility, we apply them in the latent space of powerful pretrained autoencoders. In contrast to previous work, training diffusion models on such a representation allows for the first time to reach a near-optimal point between complexity reduction and detail preservation, greatly boosting visual fidelity. By introducing cross-attention layers into the model architecture, we turn diffusion models into powerful and flexible generators for general conditioning inputs such as text or bounding boxes and high-resolution synthesis becomes possible in a convolutional manner. Our latent diffusion models (LDMs) achieve a new state of the art for image inpainting and highly competitive performance on various tasks, including unconditional image generation, semantic scene synthesis, and super-resolution, while significantly reducing computational requirements compared to pixel-based DMs. Code is available at https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion .},

  abstract = {Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.},

  abstract = {The game of Go has long been viewed as the most challenging of classic games for artificial intelligence owing to its enormous search space and the difficulty of evaluating board positions and moves. Here we introduce a new approach to computer Go that uses ‘value networks’ to evaluate board positions and ‘policy networks’ to select moves. These deep neural networks are trained by a novel combination of supervised learning from human expert games, and reinforcement learning from games of self-play. Without any lookahead search, the neural networks play Go at the level of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tree search programs that simulate thousands of random games of self-play. We also introduce a new search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks. Using this search algorithm, our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8\% winning rate against other Go programs, and defeated the human European Go champion by 5 games to 0. This is the first time that a computer program has defeated a human professional player in the full-sized game of Go, a feat previously thought to be at least a decade away.},

  abstract = {Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1–4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’8—has been an important open research problem for more than 50~years9. Despite recent progress10–14, existing methods fall far~short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

These models represent a molecule as a graph using only the distance between atoms (nodes). They do not, however, consider the spatial direction from one atom to another, despite directional information playing a central role in empirical potentials for molecules, e.g. in angular potentials. To alleviate this limitation we propose directional message passing, in which we embed the messages passed between atoms instead of the atoms themselves. Each message is associated with a direction in coordinate space. These directional message embeddings are rotationally equivariant since the associated directions rotate with the molecule. We propose a message passing scheme analogous to belief propagation, which uses the directional information by transforming messages based on the angle between them. Additionally, we use spherical Bessel functions and spherical harmonics to construct theoretically well-founded, orthogonal representations that achieve better performance than the currently prevalent Gaussian radial basis representations while using fewer than 1/4 of the parameters. We leverage these innovations to construct the directional message passing neural network (DimeNet). DimeNet outperforms previous GNNs on average by 76\% on MD17 and by 31\% on QM9. Our implementation is available online.},

In a number of experiments on citation networks and on a knowledge graph dataset we demonstrate that our approach outperforms related methods by a significant margin.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has undergone a renaissance recently, making major progress in key domains such as vision, language, control, and decision-making. This has been due, in part, to cheap data and cheap compute resources, which have fit the natural strengths of deep learning. However, many defining characteristics of human intelligence, which developed under much different pressures, remain out of reach for current approaches. In particular, generalizing beyond one's experiences--a hallmark of human intelligence from infancy--remains a formidable challenge for modern AI. The following is part position paper, part review, and part unification. We argue that combinatorial generalization must be a top priority for AI to achieve human-like abilities, and that structured representations and computations are key to realizing this objective. Just as biology uses nature and nurture cooperatively, we reject the false choice between "hand-engineering" and "end-to-end" learning, and instead advocate for an approach which benefits from their complementary strengths. We explore how using relational inductive biases within deep learning architectures can facilitate learning about entities, relations, and rules for composing them. We present a new building block for the AI toolkit with a strong relational inductive bias--the graph network--which generalizes and extends various approaches for neural networks that operate on graphs, and provides a straightforward interface for manipulating structured knowledge and producing structured behaviors. We discuss how graph networks can support relational reasoning and combinatorial generalization, laying the foundation for more sophisticated, interpretable, and flexible patterns of reasoning. As a companion to this paper, we have released an open-source software library for building graph networks, with demonstrations of how to use them in practice.},

  abstract = {Supervised learning on molecules has incredible potential to be useful in chemistry, drug discovery, and materials science. Luckily, several promising and closely related neural network models invariant to molecular symmetries have already been described in the literature. These models learn a message passing algorithm and aggregation procedure to compute a function of their entire input graph. At this point, the next step is to find a particularly effective variant of this general approach and apply it to chemical prediction benchmarks until we either solve them or reach the limits of the approach. In this paper, we reformulate existing models into a single common framework we call Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) and explore additional novel variations within this framework. Using MPNNs we demonstrate state of the art results on an important molecular property prediction benchmark; these results are strong enough that we believe future work should focus on datasets with larger molecules or more accurate ground truth labels.},

abstract = {This chapter addresses the role that data-driven approaches, especially machine learning methods, are expected to play in materials research in the immediate future. Machine learning, an important part of artificial intelligence, has made monumental contributions to areas outside materials science, ranging from commerce to gaming to search engines to drug design. Machine learning algorithms can be separated into two broad classes: supervised and unsupervised learning. The chapter first provides the necessary mathematical background to allow a materials researcher entering this field to use these methods most effectively. It then presents an assortment of examples of recent machine learning applications within materials science. The chapter also discusses a range of emerging efforts, including high-throughput phase diagram and crystal structure determination methods, accelerated prediction of materials properties, development of interatomic potentials and functionals for accelerating materials simulations, and efficient and low-cost methods for materials process control},

  abstract = {Inverse optimal control (IOC) is a powerful theory that addresses the inverse problems in control systems, robotics, Machine Learning (ML) and optimization taking into account the optimal manners. This paper reviews the history of the IOC and Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) approaches and describes the connections and differences between them to cover the research gap in the existing literature. The general formulation of IOC/IRL is described and the related methods are categorized based on a hierarchical approach. For this purpose, IOC methods are categorized under two classes, namely classic and modern approaches. The classic IOC is typically formulated for control systems, while IRL, as a modern approach to IOC, is considered for machine learning problems. Despite the presence of a handful of IOC/IRL methods, a comprehensive categorization of these methods is lacking. In addition to the IOC/IRL problems, this paper elaborates, where necessary, on other relevant concepts such as Learning from Demonstration (LfD), Imitation Learning (IL), and Behavioral Cloning. Some of the challenges encountered in the IOC/IRL problems are further discussed in this work, including ill-posedness, non-convexity, data availability, non-linearity, the curses of complexity and dimensionality, feature selection, and generalizability.},

The inverse problems for the time-dependent differential equations of isotropic and anisotropic elasticity are reviewed in the following section of the paper. These problems were the objects of the study by many authors in the last several decades. The physical interpretations for almost all of these problems are given, and the geophysical applications for some of them are described. In our last section, an introduction with many links into the literature is given for modern algorithms which combine techniques from classical inverse problems with stochastic tools into ensemble methods both for data assimilation as well as for forecasting.},

A central stepping stone toward realizing this promise is the demonstration of multifunctionality under several constraints (e.g., at multiple incident wavelengths and/or angles) in a single device, an achievement being hampered by design limitations inherent to single-layer planar geometries. Here, we propose a framework for the inverse design of multilayer metaoptics via topology optimization, showing that even few-wavelength thick devices can achieve high-efficiency multifunctionality, such as multiangle light concentration and plan-achromaticity. We embody our framework in multiple closely spaced patterned layers of a low-index polymer, with fabrication constraints specific to this platform enforced in the optimization process. We experimentally demonstrate our approach with an inverse-designed 3D-printed light concentrator working at five different nonparaxial angles of incidence. Our framework paves the way toward realizing multifunctional ultracompact 3D nanophotonic devices.},

The method was originally developed for mechanical design problems but has within the last six years been applied to a range of photonics applications. Topology optimization may be based on finite element and finite difference type modeling methods in both frequency and time domain. The basic idea is that the material density of each element or grid point is a design variable, hence the geometry is parameterized in a pixel-like fashion. The optimization problem is efficiently solved using mathematical programming-based optimization methods and analytical gradient calculations.

Since the training is performed on digital hardware, in this paper, we analyze what actually can be computed on current hardware platforms modeled as Turing machines, which would lead to inherent restrictions of deep learning. For this, we focus on the class of inverse problems, which, in particular, encompasses any task to reconstruct data from measurements. We prove that finite-dimensional inverse problems are not Banach-Mazur computable for small relaxation parameters. In fact, our result even holds for Borel-Turing computability., i.e., there does not exist an algorithm which performs the training of a neural network on digital hardware for any given accuracy. Even more, our results introduce a lower bound on the accuracy that can be obtained algorithmically. This establishes a conceptual barrier on the capabilities of neural networks for finite-dimensional inverse problems given that the computations are performed on digital hardware.},

However, the present-day staggering variety of colloidal building blocks and the limitless number of thermodynamic conditions make a systematic exploration intractable. The true challenge in this field is to turn this logic around, and to develop a robust, versatile algorithm to inverse design colloids that self-assemble into a target structure. Here, we introduce a generic inverse design method to efficiently reverse-engineer crystals, quasicrystals, and liquid crystals by targeting their diffraction patterns. Our algorithm relies on the synergetic use of an evolutionary strategy for parameter optimization, and a convolutional neural network as an order parameter, and provides a new way forward for the inverse design of experimentally feasible colloidal interactions, specifically optimized to stabilize the desired structure.},

These ideas have contributed in large measure to advancing, accelerating, and expanding the scope of discovery. Recent advances in data analytics can potentially transform the discipline of chemistry and its practice. However, taking advantage of the “Big Data” paradigm requires a distinctive set of skills that are not thus far in the usual repertoire of chemistry or materials science graduate students who typically receive little formal training in handling large data sets. In this Chapter, we outline a recently initiated interdisciplinary graduate program focused on “Data-Enabled Discovery and Design of Energy Materials (D3EM)” that seeks to explore a novel model for interdisciplinary graduate education with a materials chemistry and materials science core at Texas A\&M University. D3EM’s overarching goal is to develop and institutionalize a new training model that produces scientists/engineers grounded in one discipline but who have the professional and technical skills to collaborate and lead interdisciplinary teams, throughout their academic careers and beyond. The contribution seeks to outline our motivations for designing an interdisciplinary program, describes the structure of the program, and provides specific case studies of research projects that have benefited from an interdisciplinary perspective. Some salient aspects of the program include: 1) learning outcomes aligned with critical skills identified by potential employers; 2) a comprehensive e-portfolio to enable students to internalize interdisciplinarity; 3) a capstone Materials Discovery and Design Studio to promote interdisciplinary approaches to the solution of complex materials development problems; 4) the creation of a faculty community of scholars to facilitate the internalization of interdisciplinarity within faculty participants; and 5) a first-year graduate training sequence featuring strong disciplinary grounding followed by an interdisciplinary immersion––to ensure that the student have a sufficient disciplinary foundation.},

However, thoroughly and efficiently sampling the entire design space in a computationally tractable manner remains a highly challenging task. To tackle this problem, we propose an inverse design framework (MatDesINNe) utilizing invertible neural networks which can map both forward and reverse processes between the design space and target property. This approach can be used to generate materials candidates for a designated property, thereby satisfying the highly sought-after goal of inverse design. We then apply this framework to the task of band gap engineering in two-dimensional materials, starting with MoS2. Within the design space encompassing six degrees of freedom in applied tensile, compressive and shear strain plus an external electric field, we show the framework can generate novel, high fidelity, and diverse candidates with near-chemical accuracy. We extend this generative capability further to provide insights regarding metal-insulator transition, important for memristive neuromorphic applications among others, in MoS2 which is not otherwise possible with brute force screening. This approach is general and can be directly extended to other materials and their corresponding design spaces and target properties.},

  abstract = {The ability to readily design novel materials with chosen functional properties on-demand represents a next frontier in materials discovery. However, thoroughly and efficiently sampling the entire design space in a computationally tractable manner remains a highly challenging task. To tackle this problem, we propose an inverse design framework (MatDesINNe) utilizing invertible neural networks which can map both forward and reverse processes between the design space and target property. This approach can be used to generate materials candidates for a designated property, thereby satisfying the highly sought-after goal of inverse design. We then apply this framework to the task of band gap engineering in two-dimensional materials, starting with MoS2. Within the design space encompassing six degrees of freedom in applied tensile, compressive and shear strain plus an external electric field, we show the framework can generate novel, high fidelity, and diverse candidates with near-chemical accuracy. We extend this generative capability further to provide insights regarding metal-insulator transition in MoS2 which are important for memristive neuromorphic applications, among others. This approach is general and can be directly extended to other materials and their corresponding design spaces and target properties.},

  abstract = {Many phenomena in physics, including light, water waves, and sound, are described by wave equations. Given their coefficients, wave equations can be solved to high accuracy, but the presence of the wavelength scale often leads to large computer simulations for anything beyond the simplest geometries. The inverse problem, determining the coefficients from a field on a boundary, is even more demanding, since traditional optimization requires a large number of forward problems be solved sequentially. Here we show that the free-form inverse problem of wave equations can be solved with machine learning. First we show that deep neural networks can be used to predict the optical properties of nanostructured materials such as metasurfaces. Then we demonstrate the free-form inverse design of such nanostructures and show that constraints imposed by experimental feasibility can be taken into account. Our neural networks promise automated design in several technologies based on the wave equation.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the possibilities of applying physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) in topology optimization (TO) by introducing a fully self-supervised TO framework that is based on PINNs. This framework solves the forward elasticity problem by the deep energy method (DEM). Instead of training a separate neural network to update the density distribution, we leverage the fact that the compliance minimization problem is self-adjoint to express the element sensitivity directly in terms of the displacement field from the DEM model, and thus no additional neural network is needed for the inverse problem. The method of moving asymptotes is used as the optimizer for updating density distribution. The implementation of Neumann, Dirichlet, and periodic boundary conditions are described in the context of the DEM model. Three numerical examples are presented to demonstrate framework capabilities: (1) Compliance minimization in 2D under different geometries and loading, (2) Compliance minimization in 3D, and (3) Maximization of homogenized shear modulus to design 2D meta material unit cells. The results show that the optimized designs from the DEM-based framework are very comparable to those generated by the finite element method, and shed light on a new way of integrating PINN-based simulation methods into classical computational mechanics problems.},

  abstract = {The braking performance of the brake system is a target performance that must be considered for vehicle development. Apparent piston travel (APT) and drag torque are the most representative factors for evaluating braking performance. In particular, as the two performance factors have a conflicting relationship with each other, a multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) approach is required for brake design. However, the computational cost of MDO increases as the number of disciplines increases. Recent studies on inverse design that use deep learning (DL) have established the possibility of instantly generating an optimal design that can satisfy the target performance without implementing an iterative optimization process. This study proposes a DL-based multidisciplinary inverse design (MID) that simultaneously satisfies multiple targets, such as the APT and drag torque of the brake system. Results show that the proposed inverse design can find the optimal design more efficiently compared with the conventional optimization methods, such as backpropagation and sequential quadratic programming. The MID achieved a similar performance to the single-disciplinary inverse design in terms of accuracy and computational cost. A novel design was derived on the basis of results, and the same performance was satisfied as that of the existing design.},

  abstract = {Recovering a function or high-dimensional parameter vector from indirect measurements is a central task in various scientific areas. Several methods for solving such inverse problems are well developed and well understood. Recently, novel algorithms using deep learning and neural networks for inverse problems appeared. While still in their infancy, these techniques show astonishing performance for applications like low-dose CT or various sparse data problems. However, there are few theoretical results for deep learning in inverse problems. In this paper, we establish a complete convergence analysis for the proposed NETT (network Tikhonov) approach to inverse problems. NETT considers nearly data-consistent solutions having small value of a regularizer defined by a trained neural network. We derive well-posedness results and quantitative error estimates, and propose a possible strategy for training the regularizer. Our theoretical results and framework are different from any previous work using neural networks for solving inverse problems. A possible data driven regularizer is proposed. Numerical results are presented for a tomographic sparse data problem, which demonstrate good performance of NETT even for unknowns of different type from the training data. To derive the convergence and convergence rates results we introduce a new framework based on the absolute Bregman distance generalizing the standard Bregman distance from the convex to the non-convex case.},

The effective parameters of these architected materials render unprecedented control over the optical properties of light, thereby eliciting previously unattainable applications in flat lenses, holographic imaging, and emission control among others. The design of such structures, to date, has relied on the expertise of an optical scientist to guide a progression of electromagnetic simulations that iteratively solve Maxwell’s equations until a locally optimized solution can be attained. In this work, we identify a solution to circumvent this intuition-guided design by means of a deep learning architecture. When fed an input set of optical spectra, the constructed generative network assimilates a candidate pattern from a user-defined dataset of geometric structures in order to match the input spectra. The generated metamaterial patterns demonstrate high fidelity, yielding equivalent optical spectra at an average accuracy of about 0.9. This approach reveals an opportunity to expedite the discovery and design of metasurfaces for tailored optical responses in a systematic, inverse-design manner.},

  abstract = {The research of metamaterials has achieved enormous success in the manipulation of light in an artificially prescribed manner using delicately designed sub-wavelength structures, so-called meta-atoms. Even though modern numerical methods allow to accurately calculate the optical response of complex structures, the inverse design of metamaterials is still a challenging task due to the non-intuitive and non-unique relationship between physical structures and optical responses. To better unveil this implicit relationship and thus facilitate metamaterial design, we propose to represent metamaterials and model the inverse design problem in a probabilistically generative manner. By employing an encoder-decoder configuration, our deep generative model compresses the meta-atom design and optical response into a latent space, where similar designs and similar optical responses are automatically clustered together. Therefore, by sampling in the latent space, the stochastic latent variables function as codes, from which the candidate designs are generated upon given requirements in a decoding process. With the effective latent representation of metamaterials, we can elegantly model the complex structure-performance relationship in an interpretable way, and solve the one-to-many mapping issue that is intractable in a deterministic model. Moreover, to alleviate the burden of numerical calculation in data collection, we develop a semi-supervised learning strategy that allows our model to utilize unlabeled data in addition to labeled data during training, simultaneously optimizing the generative inverse design and deterministic forward prediction in an end-to-end manner. On a data-driven basis, the proposed model can serve as a comprehensive and efficient tool that accelerates the design, characterization and even new discovery in the research domain of metamaterials and photonics in general.},

  abstract = {History matching refers to calibration of geologic models so that they can reproduce historical production data. Automatic history matching is performed by solving inverse problems, in which production data mismatch is minimized by iteratively updating reservoir parameters in the direction of decreasing loss function. Conventional algorithms involve many reservoir simulation runs that must be performed online (during history matching), which make the process time-consuming. We have developed a novel machine learning-based approach to history matching where the goal is to learn the mapping from model input and response data during the training phase and use the trained model to generate calibrated reservoir models for a given production data. The advantage of this approach is that the time-consuming training step is performed off-line, enabling a more real-time history matching workflow with the trained model. A challenging aspect in history matching is that historical production data support only coarse-scale geologic features. Hence, without proper parameterization and regularization, the resulting inverse problems are ill-posed. Similarly, the computational efficiency is significantly improved by learning the mapping between low-dimensional representations of geologic realizations and the associated simulated production data. We demonstrate the new approach using a 2D Gaussian field and a complex 3D channelized reservoir. © 81st EAGE Conference and Exhibition 2019. All rights reserved.},

We use the prediction of SS prototypes for spintronic applications as an illustrative example of the proposed workflow. The prediction process starts with the establishment of the design principles (the physical mechanism behind the target properties), that are used as filters for materials screening, and followed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Applying this process to the C2DB database, we identify and classify 358 2D materials according to SS type at the valence and/or conduction bands. The Bayesian optimization captures trends that are used for the rationalized design of 2D materials with the ideal conditions of band gap and SS for potential spintronics applications.

The explosive growth in scientific literature and data has made it ever harder to discover useful insights in a large mass of information. Today scientific knowledge is accessed through search engines, but they are unable to organize scientific knowledge alone. In this paper we introduce Galactica: a large language model that can store, combine and reason about scientific knowledge. We train on a large scientific corpus of papers, reference material, knowledge bases and many other sources. We outperform existing models on a range of scientific tasks. On technical knowledge probes such as LaTeX equations, Galactica outperforms the latest GPT-3 by 68.2\% versus 49.0\%. Galactica also performs well on reasoning, outperforming Chinchilla on mathematical MMLU by 41.3\% to 35.7\%, and PaLM 540B on MATH with a score of 20.4\% versus 8.8\%. It also sets a new state-of-the-art on downstream tasks such as PubMedQA and MedMCQA dev of 77.6\% and 52.9\%. And despite not being trained on a general corpus, Galactica outperforms BLOOM and OPT-175B on BIG-bench.

  abstract = {This article serves as an introduction to the other articles in this issue devoted to the problem of the localization of neural generators. Elements of the theory of electric volume conduction are briefly introduced, as far as these apply to the interpretation of observed scalp potentials. First, some basic methods for display of the different aspects of the spatiotemporal information are described. Next, the most prominent source and volume conductor models that have been postulated for the involved forward problem are summarized. The problems of source identification and source localization, known as the inverse problem, are then formulated in terms of a parameter estimation procedure. The importance of introducing a priori information in the inverse problem, aimed at stabilizing (regularizing) the obtained solution, is emphasized. Methods for imposing such constraints are briefly outlined.},

  abstract = {It is safe to say that every invention that has changed the world has depended on materials. At present, the demand for the development of materials and the invention or design of new materials is becoming more and more urgent since peoples’ current production and lifestyle needs must be changed to help mitigate the climate. Structure-property relationships are a vital paradigm in materials science. However, these relationships are often nonlinear, and the pattern is likely to change with length scales and time scales, posing a huge challenge. With the development of physics, statistics, computer science, etc., machine learning offers the opportunity to systematically find new materials. Especially by inverse design based on machine learning, one can make use of the existing knowledge without attempting mathematical inversion of the relevant integrated differential equation of the electronic structure but by using backpropagation to overcome local minimax traps and perform a fast calculation of the gradient information for a target function concerning the design variable to find the optimizations. The methodologies have been applied to various materials including polymers, photonics, inorganic materials, porous materials, 2-D materials, etc. Different types of design problems require different approaches, for which many algorithms and optimization approaches have been demonstrated in different scenarios. In this mini-review, we will not specifically sum up machine learning methodologies, but will provide a more material perspective and summarize some cut-edging studies.},

  abstract = {Generating the periodic structure of stable materials is a long-standing challenge for the material design community. This task is difficult because stable materials only exist in a low-dimensional subspace of all possible periodic arrangements of atoms: 1) the coordinates must lie in the local energy minimum defined by quantum mechanics, and 2) global stability also requires the structure to follow the complex, yet specific bonding preferences between different atom types. Existing methods fail to incorporate these factors and often lack proper invariances. We propose a Crystal Diffusion Variational Autoencoder (CDVAE) that captures the physical inductive bias of material stability. By learning from the data distribution of stable materials, the decoder generates materials in a diffusion process that moves atomic coordinates towards a lower energy state and updates atom types to satisfy bonding preferences between neighbors. Our model also explicitly encodes interactions across periodic boundaries and respects permutation, translation, rotation, and periodic invariances. We significantly outperform past methods in three tasks: 1) reconstructing the input structure, 2) generating valid, diverse, and realistic materials, and 3) generating materials that optimize a specific property. We also provide several standard datasets and evaluation metrics for the broader machine learning community.},

However, the number of known materials deposited in the popular materials databases such as ICSD and Materials Project is extremely limited and consists of just a tiny portion of the vast chemical design space. Herein we present an active generative inverse design method that combines active learning with a deep variational autoencoder neural network and a generative adversarial deep neural network model to discover new materials with a target property in the whole chemical design space. The application of this method has allowed us to discover new thermodynamically stable materials with high band gap (SrYF\$\_5\$) and semiconductors with specified band gap ranges (SrClF\$\_3\$, CaClF\$\_5\$, YCl\$\_3\$, SrC\$\_2\$F\$\_3\$, AlSCl, As\$\_2\$O\$\_3\$), all of which are verified by the first principle DFT calculations. Our experiments show that while active learning itself may sample chemically infeasible candidates, these samples help to train effective screening models for filtering out materials with desired properties from the hypothetical materials created by the generative model. The experiments show the effectiveness of our active generative inverse design approach.},

  abstract = {In recent years, hybrid design strategies combining machine learning (ML) with electromagnetic optimization algorithms have emerged as a new paradigm for the inverse design of photonic structures and devices. While a trained, data-driven neural network can rapidly identify solutions near the global optimum with a given data set’s design space, an iterative optimization algorithm can further refine the solution and overcome data set limitations. Furthermore, such hybrid ML-optimization methodologies can reduce computational costs and expedite the discovery of novel electromagnetic components. However, existing hybrid ML-optimization methods have yet to optimize across both materials and geometries in a single integrated and user-friendly environment. In addition, due to the challenge of acquiring large data sets for ML, as well as the exponential growth of isolated models being trained for photonics design, there is a need to standardize the ML-optimization workflow while making the pretrained models easily accessible. Motivated by these challenges, here we introduce DeepAdjoint, a general-purpose, open-source, and multiobjective “all-in-one” global photonics inverse design application framework that integrates pretrained deep generative networks with state-of-the-art electromagnetic optimization algorithms such as the adjoint variables method. DeepAdjoint allows a designer to specify an arbitrary optical design target, then obtain a photonic structure that is robust to fabrication tolerances and possesses the desired optical properties, all within a single user-guided application interface. We demonstrate DeepAdjoint for the design of infrared-controlled metasurfaces and show that a wide range of structures and absorption spectra can be achieved and optimized, including single- and multiresonance behavior through single- and supercell-class structures, respectively. Our framework, thus, paves a path toward the systematic unification of ML and optimization algorithms for photonic inverse design.},

The resulting structures scatter light in a way that is radically different from either a conventional lens or a random microstructure, and suppress the noise sensitivity of the inverse-scattering computation by several orders of magnitude. Incorporating the full wave physics is especially crucial for detecting spectral and polarization information that is discarded by geometric optics and scalar diffraction theory.},

The large-scale case involves the computational complexity of the underlying optimization algorithm in non-trivial ways. Unlikely optimization algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent show amazing performance for large-scale problems.

In general, the laws of physics provide the means for computing the data values given a model. This is called the “forward problem”, see figure 1. In the inverse problem, the aim is to reconstruct the model from a set of measurements. In the ideal case, an exact theory exists that prescribes how the data should be transformed in order to reproduce the model. For some selected examples such a theory exists assuming that the required infinite and noise-free data sets would be available. A quantum mechanical potential in one spatial dimension can be reconstructed when the reflection coefficient is known for all energies [Marchenko, 1955; Burridge, 1980]. This technique can be generalized for the reconstruction of a quantum mechanical potential in three dimensions [Newton, 1989], but in that case a redundant data set is required for reasons that are not well understood. The mass-density in a one-dimensional string can be constructed from the measurements of all eigenfrequencies of that string [Borg, 1946], but due to the symmetry of this problem only the even part of the mass-density can be determined. If the seismic velocity in the earth depends only on depth, the velocity can be constructed exactly from the measurement of the arrival time as a function of distance of seismic waves using an Abel transform [Herglotz, 1907], [Wiechert, 1907].},

  abstract = {Abstract Discovering modeling errors on large finite element models is complex and can often go unnoticed, particularly once good “correlation” is achieved. The signs of trouble and/or inaccuracies need to be recognized and, at the very least, the effects of system simplifications on a model's accuracy need to be known. One danger in using simplified models occurs when the models, which have been correlated to test results, are used for predictive work. When predictive work begins, it is extremely difficult to determine if model “simplifications” have a small or large influence on the predictions. Fortunately, there are things that can be done to help recognize potential trouble. Similar to the examples shown in this paper, a library of small test models should be created in order to evaluate modeling techniques and code features. The evaluation should include determining limitations of the techniques and features that may cause modeling errors when applied to larger systems. This is analogous to the design process itself, where components must first be designed and thoroughly tested and understood before they can be reliably used in larger systems.}

  abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter focuses on ill-posed problems in partial differential equations. Typically, solutions of ill-posed problems, unless they are appropriately constrained, will not depend continuously on any quantities that are subject to error in the modeling of the problem, and it is never clear a priori that a constraint that will bring about continuous dependence under one type of perturbation will also guarantee continuous dependence under another. For instance, a constraint set restriction that implies continuous dependence on the Cauchy data will not necessarily insure continuous dependence on coefficients. Two major sources of error have been largely ignored in the literature: (1) errors in geometry and (2) errors in modeling. The latter errors are in general more difficult to deal with than the more commonly treated errors in Cauchy data. In fact, it is the inability to adequately regularize against such errors that casts doubt on the entire study of ill-posed problems in partial differential equations as an accurate predictor of what will occur in the physical situation being modeled. Under errors in geometry, there are obvious errors in spatial geometry, but there are types of errors that might result from the fact that not all of the data is measured precisely at time to but rather over some interval of time. The chapter presents some examples of both types of perturbations of geometry.}

  abstract = {Global seismic tomography has produced a great amount of robust information concerning the three-dimensional extent of the Earth's internal structure. This has stimulated a multidisciplinary discussion aimed at understanding the mechanisms which govern the internal evolution of our planet. A brief overview of seismic tomography is presented. Since geodynamical understanding is the main purpose of seismic tomography, some suggestions are made on how to evolve from a predominantly qualitative to a more quantitative interpretation of its results. We argue that without a more systematic and realistic error and resolution analysis, interpretations might be misleading. Assuming a steady increase of data quality and coverage, the most challenging aspect of seismic tomography will be to take the nonlinearity of the problem fully into account. It is hoped that this contribution stimulates some discussion in that direction.},

  abstract = {Conventional gravity inversion techniques have limited ability to quantify structural uncertainty in geologic models. In this paper, a stochastic framework is proposed that directly incorporates fault-related and density-related uncertainty into the inversion process. The approach uses Monte Carlo simulation to generate model realizations and the gradual deformation method to further refine models to match observed data. To guarantee that model realizations are structurally restorable, fault displacements are generated using a kinematic modeling approach in which fault model properties such as the number of faults, location, dip, slip, and orientation are considered uncertain. Using a synthetic case study problem, a reference gravity field was inverted to generate a suite of posterior model realizations. Analysis of the posterior models was used to create a fault probability map as well as quantify the distribution of slip and dip of faults in three zones of deformation. Uncertainty in density values was found to be greatly reduced in the top 250~m depth, suggesting limited sensitivity to deeper sources in this example. Following the synthetic case study problem, the inversion approach was applied to a field-observed gravity profile in Dixie Valley, Nevada, and the inversion results were compared to a previously published forward gravity model. By generating a suite of posterior models, structural uncertainty can be better assessed to make more informed decisions in a host of subsurface modeling problems.},

  abstract = {Computational high throughput screening (HTS) has emerged as a significant tool in material science to accelerate the discovery of new materials with target properties in recent years. However, despite many successful cases in which HTS led to the novel discovery, currently, the major bottleneck in HTS is a large computational cost of density functional theory (DFT) calculations that scale cubically with system size, limiting the chemical space that can be explored. The present work aims at addressing this computational burden of HTS by presenting a machine learning (ML) framework that can efficiently explore the chemical space. Our model is built upon an existing crystal graph convolutional neural network (CGCNN) to obtain formation energy of a crystal structure but is modified to allow uncertainty quantification for each prediction using the hyperbolic tangent activation function and dropout algorithm (CGCNN-HD). The uncertainty quantification is particularly important since typical usage of CGCNN (due to the lack of gradient implementation) does not involve structural relaxation which could cause substantial prediction errors. The proposed method is benchmarked against an existing application that identified promising photoanode material among the {$>$}7,000 hypothetical Mg–Mn–O ternary compounds using all DFT-HTS. In our approach, we perform the approximate HTS using CGCNN-HD and refine the results using full DFT for those selected (denoted as ML/DFT-HTS). The proposed hybrid model reduces the required DFT calculations by a factor of {$>$}50 compared to the previous DFT-HTS in making the same discovery of Mg2MnO4, experimentally validated new photoanode material. Further analysis demonstrates that the addition of HD components with uncertainty measures in the CGCNN-HD model increased the discoverability of promising materials relative to all DFT-HTS from 30\% (CGCNN) to 68\% (CGCNN-HD). The present ML/DFT-HTS with uncertainty quantification can thus be a fast alternative to DFT-HTS for efficient exploration of the vast chemical space.},

  abstract = {The recently proposed crystal graph convolutional neural network (CGCNN) offers a highly versatile and accurate machine learning (ML) framework by learning material properties directly from graph-like representations of crystal structures ("crystal graphs"). Here, we develop an improved variant of the CGCNN model (iCGCNN) that outperforms the original by incorporating information of the Voronoi tessellated crystal structure, explicit 3-body correlations of neighboring constituent atoms, and an optimized chemical representation of interatomic bonds in the crystal graphs. We demonstrate the accuracy of the improved framework in two distinct illustrations: First, when trained/validated on 180,000/20,000 density functional theory (DFT) calculated thermodynamic stability entries taken from the Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD) and evaluated on a separate test set of 230,000 entries, iCGCNN achieves a predictive accuracy that is significantly improved, i.e., 20\% higher than that of the original CGCNN. Second, when used to assist high-throughput search for materials in the ThCr2Si2 structure-type, iCGCNN exhibited a success rate of 31\% which is 310 times higher than an undirected high-throughput search and 2.4 times higher than that of the original CGCNN. Using both CGCNN and iCGCNN, we screened 132,600 compounds with elemental decorations of the ThCr2Si2 prototype crystal structure and identified a total of 97 new unique stable compounds by performing 757 DFT calculations, accelerating the computational time of the high-throughput search by a factor of 130. Our results suggest that the iCGCNN can be used to accelerate high-throughput discoveries of new materials by quickly and accurately identifying crystalline compounds with properties of interest.},

  abstract = {Deep learning tools have gained tremendous attention in applied machine learning. However such tools for regression and classification do not capture model uncertainty. In comparison, Bayesian models offer a mathematically grounded framework to reason about model uncertainty, but usually come with a prohibitive computational cost. In this paper we develop a new theoretical framework casting dropout training in deep neural networks (NNs) as approximate Bayesian inference in deep Gaussian processes. A direct result of this theory gives us tools to model uncertainty with dropout NNs -- extracting information from existing models that has been thrown away so far. This mitigates the problem of representing uncertainty in deep learning without sacrificing either computational complexity or test accuracy. We perform an extensive study of the properties of dropout's uncertainty. Various network architectures and non-linearities are assessed on tasks of regression and classification, using MNIST as an example. We show a considerable improvement in predictive log-likelihood and RMSE compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, and finish by using dropout's uncertainty in deep reinforcement learning.},

With increased interest in development of advanced electrical energy storage systems, it is essential to find new electrolytes that function effectively. This Perspective reviews various methods for screening electrolytes and then describes a hierarchical computational scheme to screen multiple properties of advanced electrical energy storage electrolytes using high-throughput quantum chemical calculations. The approach effectively down-selects a large pool of candidates based on successive property evaluation. As an example, results of screening are presented for redox potentials, solvation energies, and structural changes of ∼1400 organic molecules for nonaqueous redox flow batteries. Importantly, on the basis of high-throughput screening, in silico design of suitable candidate molecules for synthesis and electrochemical testing can be achieved. We anticipate that the computational approach described in this Perspective coupled with experimentation will have a significant role to play in the discovery of materials for future energy needs.},

The highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14\% was achieved by fully automated device fabrication in air with a model material system PM6:Y6. Improving molecular ordering has been identified as the most promising motif for further efficiency optimization. Thin active layers combined with medium thermal annealing temperature are favorable to simultaneously improve efficiency and suppress burn-in losses.

The current project phase is concerned with the characterization of millions of molecular motifs using first-principles quantum chemistry. The scale of this study requires a correspondingly large computational resource, which is provided by distributed volunteer computing on IBM’s World Community Grid. The results are compiled and analyzed in a reference database and will be made available for public use. In addition to finding specific candidates with certain properties, it is the goal of CEP to illuminate and understand the structure–property relations in the domain of organic electronics. Such insights can open the door to a rational and systematic design of future high-performance materials.

  abstract = {B6O is a member of icosahedral boron-rich solids known for their physical hardness and stability under irradiation bombardment, but it has also recently emerged as a promising high mobility p−type transparent conducting oxide. Using a combination of hybrid functional and many-body perturbation theory calculations, we report on the electronic structure and defect properties of this material. Our calculations identify B6O has a direct band gap in excess of 3.0 eV and possesses largely isotropic and low effective masses for both holes and electrons. Of the native defects, we identify no intrinsic origin to the reported p−type conductivity and confirm that p−type doping is not prevented by intrinsic defects such as oxygen vacancies, which we find act exclusively as neutral defects rather than hole-killing donors. We also investigate a number of common impurities and plausible dopants, finding that isolated acceptor candidates tend to yield deep states within the band gap or act instead as donors, and cannot account for p−type conductivity. Our calculations identify the only shallow acceptor candidate to be a complex consisting of interstitial H bonded to C substituting on the O site (CH)O. We therefore attribute the origins of p−type conductivity to these complexes formed during growth or more likely via isolated CO which later binds with H within the crystal. Lastly, we identify Si as a plausible n−type dopant, as it favorably acts as a shallow donor and does not suffer from self-compensation as may the C-related defects. Thus, in addition to the observed p−type conductivity, B6O exhibits promise of n−type dopability if the stoichiometry and both native and extrinsic sources of compensation can be sufficiently controlled.},

  abstract = {High-performance p-type transparent conducting materials (TCMs) are needed in a wide range of applications ranging from solar cells to transparent electronics. p-type TCMs require a large band gap (for transparency), low hole effective mass (for high mobility), and hole dopability. It has been demonstrated that oxides have inherent limitations in terms of hole effective masses making them difficult to use as a high-performance p-type TCM. In this work, we use a high-throughput computational approach to identify novel, non-oxide, p-type TCMs. By data mining a large computational data set (more than 30,000 compounds), we demonstrate that non-oxide materials can lead to much lower hole effective masses but to the detriment of smaller gaps and lower transparencies. We propose a strategy to overcome this fundamental correlation between low effective mass and small band gap by exploiting the weak absorption for indirect optical transitions. We apply this strategy to phosphides and identify zinc blende boron phosphide (BP) as a very promising candidate. Follow-up computational studies on defects formation indicate that BP can also be doped p-type and potentially n-type as well. Our work demonstrates how high-throughput computational design can lead to identification of materials with exceptional properties, and we propose a strategy to open the design of TCMs to non-oxide materials.}

  abstract = {We present recent advances in numerical implementations of hybrid functionals and the GW approximation within the full-potential linearized augmented-plane-wave (FLAPW) method. The former is an approximation for the exchange–correlation contribution to the total energy functional in density-functional theory, and the latter is an approximation for the electronic self-energy in the framework of many-body perturbation theory. All implementations employ the mixed product basis, which has evolved into a versatile basis for the products of wave functions, describing the incoming and outgoing states of an electron that is scattered by interacting with another electron. It can thus be used for representing the nonlocal potential in hybrid functionals as well as the screened interaction and related quantities in GW calculations. In particular, the six-dimensional space integrals of the Hamiltonian exchange matrix elements (and exchange self-energy) decompose into sums over vector–matrix–vector products, which can be evaluated easily. The correlation part of the GW self-energy, which contains a time or frequency dependence, is calculated on the imaginary frequency axis with a subsequent analytic continuation to the real axis or, alternatively, by a direct frequency convolution of the Green function G and the dynamically screened Coulomb interaction W along a contour integration path that avoids the poles of the Green function. Hybrid-functional and GW calculations are notoriously computationally expensive. We present a number of tricks that reduce the computational cost considerably, including the use of spatial and time-reversal symmetries, modifications of the mixed product basis with the aim to optimize it for the correlation self-energy and another modification that makes the Coulomb matrix sparse, analytic expansions of the interaction potentials around the point of divergence at k = 0, and a nested density and density-matrix convergence scheme for hybrid-functional calculations. We show CPU timings for prototype semiconductors and illustrative results for GdN and ZnO.},

  abstract = {Many-body perturbation theory is a well-established ab initio electronic-structure method based on Green functions. Although computationally more demanding than density functional theory, it has the distinct advantage that the exact expressions for all relevant observables, including the ground-state total energy, in terms of the Green function are known explicitly. The most important application, however, lies in the calculation of excited states, whose energies correspond directly to the poles of the Green function in the complex frequency plane. The accuracy of results obtained within this framework is only limited by the choice of the exchange-correlation self-energy, which must still be approximated in actual implementations. In this respect, the \textbackslash (GW\textbackslash ) approximation has proved highly successful for systems governed by the Coulomb interaction. It yields band structures of solids, including the band gaps of semiconductors, as well as atomic and molecular ionization energies in very good quantitative agreement with experimental photoemission data.}

  abstract = {The successful exfoliation of graphene and other kinds of two-dimensional (2D) materials from their corresponding three-dimensional (3D) bulk counterparts has inspired researchers to screen layered bulk compounds as parent materials for potential 2D materials. With the rapid development of supercomputers and high-performance computations, high-throughput materials screening is a growing new power in materials science for the discovery of novel kinds of materials with desired functionality. Recently, many parent 3D bulks have been identified by high-throughput screening from materials databases for potential 2D materials, and several 2D materials databases are established through numerous efforts. In addition, on the basis of high-throughput computations for electronic properties and data-mining algorithms, several functional layered and 2D materials, such as electrode materials, photohydrolytic catalysts, half metals, piezoelectric monolayers and heterostructures, have been achieved. In this review, we summarize the recent progress in the high-throughput screening of parent candidates for 2D materials and their further applications, and the challenges and perspectives are also briefly discussed. We highly expect that this review could lead the way forward in the discovery of novel 2D materials and provide a guide for the further development of 2D materials.

  abstract = {Interfaces between normal and topological insulators are bound to host metallic states that are protected by time-reversal symmetry and are therefore robust against disorder and interface reconstruction. Two-dimensional topological insulators (quantum spin Hall insulators) offer a unique opportunity to change the local topology by adsorption of atoms or molecules and thus comprise an ideal platform for designing topological heterostructures. Here, we apply first principles calculations to show that the quantum spin Hall insulator 1T'-MoS2 exhibits a phase transition to a trivial insulator upon adsorption of various atoms. It is then demonstrated that one-dimensional metallic boundary states indeed arise in a ribbon geometry of alternating regions with and without adsorbed oxygen and that these boundary states generically constitute simple linear connections between valence and conduction bands. This is in sharp contrast to topological edge states that typically exhibit strong dispersion that are sensitively to a particular edge termination. The heterostructure is also suggestive of a simple design of one-dimensional metallic networks in sheets of 1T'-MoS2.}

Based on first principles calculations we find that, while the PbX systems are not topological insulators, all fluorinated PbX (PbXF2) compounds are 2D topological insulators. The quantum spin Hall insulating phase was confirmed by the explicitly calculation of the Z2 invariant. In addition we performed a thorough investigation of the role played by the (i) fluorine saturation, (ii) crystal field, and (iii) spin-orbital coupling in PbXF2. By considering nanoribbon structures, we verify the appearance of a pair of topologically protected Dirac-like edge states connecting the conduction and valence bands. The insulating phase which is a result of the spin orbit interaction, reveals that this new class of two dimensional materials present exceptional nontrivial band gaps, reaching values up to 0.99 eV at the Γ point, and an indirect band gap of 0.77 eV. The topological phase is arisen without any external field, making this system promising for nanoscale applications, using topological properties.}

Such exfoliation leads to materials with extraordinary values of crystal surface area, in excess of 1000 square meters per gram. This can result in dramatically enhanced surface activity, leading to important applications, such as electrodes in supercapacitors or batteries. Another result of exfoliation is quantum confinement of electrons in two dimensions, transforming the electron band structure to yield new types of electronic and magnetic materials. Exfoliated materials also have a range of applications in composites as molecularly thin barriers or as reinforcing or conductive fillers. Here, we review exfoliation—especially in the liquid phase—as a transformative process in material science, yielding new and exotic materials, which are radically different from their bulk, layered counterparts.},

Theoretical background and numerical methods for simulation of PhC cavities are first presented. Based on the theoretical basis, two relevant quantities, the cavity mode volume and the quality factor are discussed. Then the methods of fabrication and characterization of silicon PhC slab cavities are introduced. Several types of PhC cavities are presented, such as the usual L3 missing-hole cavity, the new concept waveguide-like parallel-hetero cavity, and the low-index nanobeam cavity. The advantages and disadvantages of each type of cavity are discussed. This will help the readers to decide which type of PhC cavities to use in particular applications. Furthermore, several integrated optical devices based on PhC cavities, such as optical filters, channel-drop filters, optical switches, and optical logic gates are described in both the working principle and operation characteristics. These devices designed and realized in our group demonstrate the wide range of applications of PhC cavities and offer possible solutions to some integrated optical problems.}

  abstract = {In recent years, many researchers have shown their interest in producing a compact high-performance optical chip that is useful for most telecommunication applications. One of the solutions is by realising photonic crystal (PhC) structures that exhibit high-quality factors in a small mode volume, V. Silicon on insulator (SOI) is one of the main contenders due to its high-index contrast between the silicon (Si) core waveguide with silica (SiO 2 ) cladding surrounding it. The maturity of silicon photonic can also be incorporated with CMOS chips making it a desired material. A strong optical confinement provided by PhC structures makes it possible to realise the compact device on a single chip. In this chapter, we will discuss a fundamental background of photonic crystal cavities mainly on one-dimensional (1D) structures, which are the simplest as compared to their counterparts, 2D and 3D PhC device structures. We have modelled a photonic crystal cavity using finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) approach. This approach uses time-dependent Maxwell equation to cover wide frequency range in a single simulation. The results are then compared with the actual measured results showing a significant agreement between them. The design will be used as basic building block for designing a more complex PhC structures that exhibit high-quality factors for applications such as filtering, DWDM and sensors.}

  abstract = {CONSPECTUS: Colloidal photonic crystals (PhCs), periodically arranged monodisperse nanoparticles, have emerged as one of the most promising materials for light manipulation because of their photonic band gaps (PBGs), which affect photons in a manner similar to the effect of semiconductor energy band gaps on electrons. The PBGs arise due to the periodic modulation of the refractive index between the building nanoparticles and the surrounding medium in space with subwavelength period. This leads to light with certain wavelengths or frequencies located in the PBG being prohibited from propagating. Because of this special property, the fabrication and application of colloidal PhCs have attracted increasing interest from researchers. The most simple and economical method for fabrication of colloidal PhCs is the bottom-up approach of nanoparticle self-assembly. Common colloidal PhCs from this approach in nature are gem opals, which are made from the ordered assembly and deposition of spherical silica nanoparticles after years of siliceous sedimentation and compression. Besides naturally occurring opals, a variety of manmade colloidal PhCs with thin film or bulk morphology have also been developed. In principle, because of the effect of Bragg diffraction, these PhC materials show different structural colors when observed from different angles, resulting in brilliant colors and important applications. However, this angle dependence is disadvantageous for the construction of some optical materials and devices in which wide viewing angles are desired. Recently, a series of colloidal PhC materials with spherical macroscopic morphology have been created. Because of their spherical symmetry, the PBGs of spherical colloidal PhCs are independent of rotation under illumination of the surface at a fixed incident angle of the light, broadening the perspective of their applications. Based on droplet templates containing colloidal nanoparticles, these spherical colloidal PhCs can be generated by evaporation-induced nanoparticle crystallization or polymerization of ordered nanoparticle crystallization arrays. In particular, because microfluidics was used for the generation of the droplet templates, the development of spherical colloidal PhCs has progressed significantly. These new strategies not only ensure monodispersity, but also increase the structural and functional diversity of the PhC beads, paving the way for the development of advanced optoelectronic devices. In this Account, we present the research progress on spherical colloidal PhCs, including their design, preparation, and potential applications. We outline various types of spherical colloidal PhCs, such as close-packed, non-close-packed, inverse opal, biphasic or multiphasic Janus structured, and core-shell structured geometries. Based on their unique optical properties, applications of the spherical colloidal PhCs for displays, sensors, barcodes, and cell culture microcarriers are presented. Future developments of the spherical colloidal PhC materials are also envisioned.}

  abstract = {Nanofiller-modified materials have been widely explored for self-sensing in diverse venues spanning civil, aerospace, robotic, and even biomedical applications. Key to self-sensing is the fact that these materials are piezoresistive – their electrical conductivity is influenced by deformation and damage. Considerable research has aimed at leveraging this for intrinsic self-sensing. However, prevailing techniques provide no information about the underlying mechanical state of the material. Instead, damage and strain must be indirectly inferred from conductivity changes. The cause of this limitation is that recovering mechanics from electrical measurements is an ill-posed, under-determined, and multi-modal inverse problem. As such, global search algorithms coupled with physically motivated constraints must be used to obtain a solution. Previously, it was demonstrated that genetic algorithms (GAs) provide a suitable means of solving the displacement-from-conductivity problem. These algorithms, while undoubtedly powerful, suffer from artifacts in the strain solutions and variability in the solutions between successive searches. The goal of this work is to explore other commonly used global search algorithms which can be used to solve the displacement-from-conductivity inverse problem. In addition to GAs, we focus on two prevailing types of metaheuristic global search algorithms: simulated annealing and particle swarm optimization. Each algorithm is tested on experimental data where a self-sensing nanocomposite was deformed and electrical impedance tomography was used to image the conductivity change. The results for each algorithm are compared to standard finite element simulations and experimental observations via digital image correlation. A comparison is then drawn between the three algorithms in terms of solution quality, variability, accuracy, and computational efficiency.},

Self-sensing based on electrical resistance measurement is effective in continuous carbon fibre polymer matrix composites, which are important for aerospace structures. This effectiveness stems from the electrical conductivity of the carbon fibres and the consequent effect of the composite microstructure on the electrical resistivity of the composite. The volume, surface region and interlaminar interface of a carbon fibre composite laminate are all associated with electrical resistance, which serves to indicate the condition of the laminate. By using an array of electrical contacts, spatially distributed sensing is achieved. The strain and stress can be in the longitudinal (in-plane) direction, through-thickness direction or other directions of a laminate. In addition, the joint interface of a fastened joint between two laminates is associated with electrical resistance, which serves to indicate the condition of the joint.}

  abstract = {Self-powered photodetectors are considered as a new type of photodetectors enabling self-powered photodetection without external power. The excellent photoresponsivity, fast photoresponse rate, low dark current, and large light on/off ratio of these photodetectors have attracted wide interest among scholars. 2D materials are widely used in self-powered photodetectors due to their excellent optical and electrical properties, unique 2D structures, and their capabilities to exhibit excellent photodetection performance. According to the self-driving mechanism of 2D material-based self-powered photodetectors, they are divided into three categories: p–n junction photodetectors, Schottky junction photodetectors, and photoelectrochemical photodetectors. From these three perspectives, the research progress of 2D material-based self-powered photodetectors is summarized in detail here. Research reports indicate that 2D material-based self-powered photodetectors have excellent self-powered photoresponse behavior, good light on/off characteristics, and wideband spectral response ranges. The excellent photoresponse performance of 2D material-based self-powered photodetectors facilitates their potential applications in the field of optoelectronic devices. In particular, self-powered photodetectors have great potential as novel emerging self-driven optoelectronic devices. Finally, directions for the further development of 2D material-based self-powered photodetectors are anticipated.},

Among their various extraordinary properties, 2DMs possess high surface area-to-volume ratios and ultra-high surface sensitivity to the environment, which are key characteristics for applications in chemical sensing. Furthermore, 2DMs' superior electrical and optical properties, combined with their excellent mechanical characteristics such as robustness and flexibility, make these materials ideal components for the fabrication of a new generation of high-performance chemical sensors. Depending on the specific device, 2DMs can be tailored to interact with various chemical species at the non-covalent level, making them powerful platforms for fabricating devices exhibiting a high sensitivity towards detection of various analytes including gases, ions and small biomolecules. Here, we will review the most enlightening recent advances in the field of chemical sensors based on atomically-thin 2DMs and we will discuss the opportunities and the challenges towards the realization of novel hybrid materials and sensing devices.}

Self-assembly methods were developed in our laboratory to fabricate 2-D particle array monolayers on mercury and water surfaces. These hexagonal arrays strongly forward Bragg diffract light to report on their array spacings. By embedding these 2-D arrays onto responsive hydrogel surfaces, 2-D PC sensing materials can be fabricated. The 2-D PC sensors utilize responsive polymer hydrogels that are chemically functionalized to show volume phase transitions in selective response to particular chemical species. Novel hydrogels were also developed in our laboratory by cross-linking proteins while preserving their native structures to maintain their selective binding affinities. The volume phase transitions swell or shrink the hydrogels, which alter their 2-D array spacings, and shift their diffraction wavelengths. These shifts can be visually detected or spectrally measured. These 2-D PC sensing materials have been used for the detection of many analytes, such as pH, surfactants, metal ions, proteins, anionic drugs, and ammonia. We are exploring the use of organogels that use low vapor pressure ionic liquids as their mobile phases for sensing atmospheric analytes.}

Through materials engineering it is feasible to study the electrical properties of two-dimensional materials which are directly related to their crystalline structure, first Brillouin zone, and dispersion energy, the latter estimated through the tight-binding model. A review of the electrical properties directly related to the crystalline structure of these materials is made in this article for the two-dimensional materials used in the design of gas sensors. It was found that most 2D sensing materials have a hexagonal crystalline structure, although some materials have monoclinic, orthorhombic and triclinic structures. Through the simulation of the mathematical models of the dispersion energy, two-dimensional and three-dimensional electronic band structures were predicted for graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and silicene, which must be known before designing a gas sensor.}

It does not involve the use of embedded or attached sensors, as the structural material is itself the sensor. Self-sensing was attained in carbon-fiber–polymer-matrix structural composites by using the interlaminar interface (i.e., the interface between the laminae of continuous fibers) as a sensor. The attributes sensed were temperature, moisture, damage, and stress. In the case of temperature sensing, the interlaminar interface functioned as either a thermistor or a thermocouple junction. The thermocouple approach required the fibers in the contacting laminae to be dissimilar, whereas the thermistor approach did not. By using two crossply laminae, a two-dimensional array of sensors was attained for spatial distribution sensing.}

These relationships form the basis for the development of photo-stimulated luminescence spectroscopy (PSLS) as a nondestructive method to determine the integrity of the thermally grown oxide (TGO) layer on jet engine turbine blades. Besides the measurement technique, the accuracy of PSLS in stress measurements is influenced by the spectral analysis methodology, which is the focus of this paper. Gradient-based algorithms have been used widely in the methods developed thus far. The approach of using genetic algorithms in the spectral analysis of R-lines and vibronic bands is presented here for the first time and validated with the well-known piezospectroscopic coefficients of the R-lines. The implementation of this method has led to significant new results in the quantification of peak shifts with uniaxial stress in the vibronic bands of the spectrum. The use of genetic algorithms is instrumental in the deconvolution and fitting of the numerous peaks in these bands. Fitting statistics, such as the fitness function and number of function evaluations, were used to assess the effectiveness of the procedures used in this method.},

  abstract = {Conductive nanocomposites have been explored extensively for structural health monitoring (SHM) due to their self-sensing nature via the piezoresistive effect. Combined with a non-invasive conductivity imaging modality such as electrical impedance tomography (EIT), piezoresistivity is a powerful tool for SHM. To date, however, the combination of the piezoresistive effect and EIT has been limited to just damage detection. From a SHM perspective, it may be more beneficial to pre-emptively predict failure before it occurs. To that end, we propose a novel methodology for failure prediction in nanocomposites using piezoresistive inversion. Our approach makes use of a genetic algorithm (GA) to determine the mechanical state of the structure using conductivity changes observed via EIT. First, a rectangular nanocomposite specimen with a central hole is manufactured. Second, the specimen is loaded in tension to induce stress concentrations near the hole. Third, EIT is used to image the resulting stress concentration-induced conductivity changes near the hole. Fourth, GA-enabled piezoresistive inversion is implemented to determine the underlying displacements from the observed conductivity changes. The strains are then determined from kinematic relations and the stresses from constitutive relations. Lastly, a failure criterion is used to predict failure. By validating our results with finite element analysis and digital image correlation, we demonstrate that the proposed approach can accurately predict the onset of failure and therefore enable unprecedented SHM capabilities in piezoresistive nanocomposites.},

  abstract = {We present a specially designed evolutionary algorithm for the prediction of surface reconstructions. This technique allows one to automatically explore stable and low-energy metastable configurations with variable surface atoms and variable surface unit cells through the whole chemical potential range. The power of evolutionary search is demonstrated by the efficient identification of diamond 2×1 (100) and 2×1 (111) surface reconstructions with a fixed number of surface atoms and a fixed cell size. With further variation of surface unit cells, we study the reconstructions of the polar surface MgO (111). Experiment has detected an oxygen trimer (ozone) motif [Plass et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 81, 4891 (1998)]. We predict another version of this motif which can be thermodynamically stable in extreme oxygen-rich conditions. Finally, we perform a variable stoichiometry search for a complex ternary system: semipolar GaN (10¯11) with and without adsorbed oxygen. The search yields a counterintuitive reconstruction based on N3 trimers. These examples demonstrate that an automated scheme to explore the energy landscape of surfaces will improve our understanding of surface reconstructions. The method presented in this paper can be generally applied to binary and multicomponent systems.},

However, such 2D boron monolayers have still not been synthesized. In this report, the synthesis of atomically thin 2D γ-boron films on copper foils is achieved by chemical vapor deposition using a mixture of pure boron and boron oxide powders as the boron source and hydrogen gas as the carrier gas. Strikingly, the optical band gap of the boron film was measured to be around 2.25 eV, which is close to the value (2.07 eV) determined by first-principles calculations, suggesting that the γ-B28 monolayer is a fascinating direct band gap semiconductor. Furthermore, a strong photoluminescence emission band was observed at approximately 626 nm, which is again due to the direct band gap. This study could pave the way for applications of two-dimensional boron materials in electronic and photonic devices.},

We compare the performance of these two approaches applied to the problem of structure prediction of the titania polymorphs. A number of well-known phases have thus been reproduced as well as several plausible novel microporous and dense structures. Two different potential parameter sets, within the Born model description of a solid, were employed. Following the Lamarckian concept in a genetic or more generally in an evolutionary algorithm, all new candidate structures are immediately relaxed (analogous to the ageing process in nature); consequently, competition within any current population to procreate only occurs between mature candidate structures, which correspond to local minima on the energy landscape. In the Darwinian scheme, no local optimisation is performed, which should result in significant saving in CPU time per candidate structure considered. We show, however, that the Lamarckian scheme (which ultimately searches for the global minimum on a simplified landscape) is more successful and efficient at generating the target structures. Analysis of why the Lamarckian scheme produced a perfect success rate uncovered a weakness in the Darwinian approach when diversity of the population is allowed to reduce, and further methodological developments are suggested.},

Since the successful isolation of graphene and other twodimensional (2D) materials, there has been a strong focus on spintronics based on 2D materials due to their attractive properties, and much progress has been made, both theoretically and experimentally. Here, we summarize recent developments in spintronics based on 2D materials. We focus mainly on materials of truly 2D nature, that is, atomic crystal layers such as graphene, phosphorene, monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides, and others, but also highlight current research foci in heterostructures or interfaces. In particular, we emphasize roles played by computation based on firstprinciples methods which has contributed significantly in the designs of spintronic materials and devices.

  abstract = {It has been long hoped that the realization of long-range ferromagnetic order in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) crystals, combined with their rich electronic and optical properties, would open up new possibilities for magnetic, magnetoelectric and magneto-optic applications. However, in 2D systems, the long-range magnetic order is strongly hampered by thermal fluctuations which may be counteracted by magnetic anisotropy, according to the Mermin-Wagner theorem. Prior efforts via defect and composition engineering, and proximity effect only locally or extrinsically introduce magnetic responses. Here we report the first experimental discovery of intrinsic long-range ferromagnetic order in pristine Cr2Ge2Te6 atomic layers by scanning magneto-optic Kerr microscopy. In such a 2D vdW soft ferromagnet, for the first time, an unprecedented control of transition temperature of \textasciitilde{} 35\% - 57\% enhancement is realized via surprisingly small fields ({$<$}= 0.3 Tesla in this work), in stark contrast to the stiffness of the transition temperature to magnetic fields in the three-dimensional regime. We found that the small applied field enables an effective anisotropy far surpassing the tiny magnetocrystalline anisotropy, opening up a sizable spin wave excitation gap. Confirmed by renormalized spin wave theory, we explain the phenomenon and conclude that the unusual field dependence of transition temperature constitutes a hallmark of 2D soft ferromagnetic vdW crystals. Our discovery of 2D soft ferromagnetic Cr2Ge2Te6 presents a close-to-ideal 2D Heisenberg ferromagnet for studying fundamental spin behaviors, and opens the door for exploring new applications such as ultra-compact spintronics.},

Recent additions include spin-valley coupled semiconductors, Ising superconductors that can be tuned into a quantum metal, possible Mott insulators with tunable charge-density waves, and topological semi-metals with edge transport. Despite this progress, there is still no 2D crystal with intrinsic magnetism, which would be useful for many technologies such as sensing, information, and data storage. Theoretically, magnetic order is prohibited in the 2D isotropic Heisenberg model at finite temperatures by the Mermin-Wagner theorem. However, magnetic anisotropy removes this restriction and enables, for instance, the occurrence of 2D Ising ferromagnetism. Here, we use magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) microscopy to demonstrate that monolayer chromium triiodide (CrI3) is an Ising ferromagnet with out-of-plane spin orientation. Its Curie temperature of 45 K is only slightly lower than the 61 K of the bulk crystal, consistent with a weak interlayer coupling. Moreover, our studies suggest a layer-dependent magnetic phase transition, showcasing the hallmark thickness-dependent physical properties typical of van der Waals crystals. Remarkably, bilayer CrI3 displays suppressed magnetization with a metamagnetic effect, while in trilayer the interlayer ferromagnetism observed in the bulk crystal is restored. Our work creates opportunities for studying magnetism by harnessing the unique features of atomically-thin materials, such as electrical control for realizing magnetoelectronics, and van der Waals engineering for novel interface phenomena.},

Spintronics, exploiting the spin degree of electrons as the information vector, is an attractive field for implementing the beyond Complemetary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) devices. Recently, two-dimensional (2D) materials have been drawing tremendous attention in spintronics owing to their distinctive spin-dependent properties, such as the ultra-long spin relaxation time of graphene and the spin–valley locking of transition metal dichalcogenides. Moreover, the related heterostructures provide an unprecedented probability of combining the different characteristics via proximity effect, which could remedy the limitation of individual 2D materials. Hence, the proximity engineering has been growing extremely fast and has made significant achievements in the spin injection and manipulation. Nevertheless, there are still challenges toward practical application; for example, the mechanism of spin relaxation in 2D materials is unclear, and the high-efficiency spin gating is not yet achieved. In this review, we focus on 2D materials and related heterostructures to systematically summarize the progress of the spin injection, transport, manipulation, and application for information storage and processing.

  abstract = {Hydrogen adatoms are shown to generate magnetic moments inside single layer graphene. Spin transport measurements on graphene spin valves exhibit a dip in the nonlocal spin signal as a function of the applied magnetic field, which is due to scattering (relaxation) of pure spin currents by exchange coupling to the magnetic moments. Furthermore, Hanle spin precession measurements indicate the presence of an exchange field generated by the magnetic moments. The entire experiment including spin transport is performed in an ultrahigh vacuum chamber, and the characteristic signatures of magnetic moment formation appear only after hydrogen adatoms are introduced. Lattice vacancies also demonstrate similar behavior indicating that the magnetic moment formation originates from pz-orbital defects.},

  abstract = {We have examined the crystallographic and magnetic properties of single crystals of CrI3, an easily cleavable, layered and insulating ferromagnet with a Curie temperature of 61 K. Our X-ray diffraction studies reveal a first-order crystallographic phase transition occurring near 210–220 K upon warming, with significant thermal hysteresis. The low-temperature structure is rhombohedral (R3̅, BiI3-type) and the high-temperature structure is monoclinic (C2/m, AlCl3-type). We find evidence for coupling between the crystallographic and magnetic degrees of freedom in CrI3, observing an anomaly in the interlayer spacing at the Curie temperature and an anomaly in the magnetic susceptibility at the structural transition. First-principles calculations reveal the importance of proper treatment of the long-ranged interlayer forces, and van der Waals density functional theory does an excellent job of predicting the crystal structures and their relative stability. Calculations also suggest that the ferromagnetic order found in the bulk material may persist into monolayer form, suggesting that CrI3 and other chromium trihalides may be promising materials for spintronic and magnetoelectronic research.},

Nevertheless, their experimental realization remains a big challenge. Through first-principles calculations, we here demonstrate the possibility of realizing 2D ferromagnetic semiconductors simply by exfoliating layered crystals of CrXTe3 (X = Si, Ge). The exfoliation of CrXTe3 is feasible due to its small cleavage energy, and CrXTe3 nanosheets can form free-standing membranes. Interestingly, upon exfoliation, the ferromagnetism and semiconducting character are well preserved from bulk to the nanosheet form. Long-range ferromagnetic order with a magnetization of 3 μB per Cr atom is confirmed in 2D CrXTe3 from classical Heisenberg model Monte Carlo simulations. Both bulk and 2D CrXTe3 are indirect-gap semiconductors with their valence and conduction bands fully spin-polarized in the same direction, which is promising for spin-polarized carrier injection and detection. We further demonstrate the tunability and enrichment of the properties of CrXTe3 nanosheets via external operations. Under moderate tensile strain, the 2D ferromagnetism can be largely enhanced. By pure electron doping or adsorbing nucleophilic molecules, CrXTe3 nanosheets become 2D half metals.},

  abstract = {A fundamental part of geophysics is to make inferences about the interior of the earth on the basis of data collected at or near the surface of the earth. In almost all cases these measured data are only indirectly related to the properties of the earth that are of interest, so an inverse problem must be solved in order to obtain estimates of the physical properties within the earth. In February of 1999 the U.S. Department of Energy sponsored a workshop that was intended to examine the methods currently being used to solve geophysical inverse problems and to consider what new approaches should be explored in the future. The interdisciplinary area between inverse problems in geophysics and optimization methods in mathematics was specifically targeted as one where an interchange of ideas was likely to be fruitful. Thus about half of the participants were actively involved in solving geophysical inverse problems and about half were actively involved in research on general optimization methods. This report presents some of the topics that were explored at the workshop and the conclusions that were reached. In general, the objective of a geophysical inverse problem is to find an earth model, described by a setmore » of physical parameters, that is consistent with the observational data. It is usually assumed that the forward problem, that of calculating simulated data for an earth model, is well enough understood so that reasonably accurate synthetic data can be generated for an arbitrary model. The inverse problem is then posed as an optimization problem, where the function to be optimized is variously called the objective function, misfit function, or fitness function. The objective function is typically some measure of the difference between observational data and synthetic data calculated for a trial model. However, because of incomplete and inaccurate data, the objective function often incorporates some additional form of regularization, such as a measure of smoothness or distance from a prior model. Various other constraints may also be imposed upon the process. Inverse problems are not restricted to geophysics, but can be found in a wide variety of disciplines where inferences must be made on the basis of indirect measurements. For instance, most imaging problems, whether in the field of medicine or non-destructive evaluation, require the solution of an inverse problem. In this report, however, the examples used for illustration are taken exclusively from the field of geophysics. The generalization of these examples to other disciplines should be straightforward, as all are based on standard second-order partial differential equations of physics. In fact, sometimes the non-geophysical inverse problems are significantly easier to treat (as in medical imaging) because the limitations on data collection, and in particular on multiple views, are not so severe as they generally are in geophysics. This report begins with an introduction to geophysical inverse problems by briefly describing four canonical problems that are typical of those commonly encountered in geophysics. Next the connection with optimization methods is made by presenting a general formulation of geophysical inverse problems. This leads into the main subject of this report, a discussion of methods for solving such problems with an emphasis upon newer approaches that have not yet become prominent in geophysics. A separate section is devoted to a subject that is not encountered in all optimization problems but is particularly important in geophysics, the need for a careful appraisal of the results in terms of their resolution and uncertainty. The impact on geophysical inverse problems of continuously improving computational resources is then discussed. The main results are then brought together in a final summary and conclusions section. « less}

  abstract = {Abstract The following general question is addressed: what can be learned about a planetary interior from measurements of the global planetary magnetic field at (or near) its surface? The discussion is placed in the context of Earth, for clarity, but the considerations apply to terrestrial planets in general (so long as the observed magnetism is either predominantly of internal origin, or else external source effects can be successfully filtered out of the observations). Attention is given to the idealized but typical situation of a rotating but spherically symmetric planet containing a highly conducting uniform fluid core surrounded by a nearly insulating rigid mantle, whose conductivity, a function of at most radius only, falls monotonically from its largest value at the base of the planetary mantle to zero at the planetary surface; the largest value of mantle conductivity as well as the mean value for the whole mantle and the mantle conductance are assumed small compared to the corresponding values of the core. Exterior to the planet is vacuum in the sense of an electrically uncharged insulator. The core fluid is inviscid, Boussinesq and gravitationally driven. Complete and perfect observations of either the instantaneous internal vector magnetic field together with its secular variation at a single epoch, or more realistically, the instantaneous internal vector magnetic field alone at two separated epochs are presumed available; the time separation between measurement epochs is long compared the Ohmic diffusion time of the planetary mantle, but small compared to that of the liquid core. Under such circumstances we describe how information about each of the following planetary properties can, in principle (though not without practical difficulty) be retrieved from the observations: (1) depth of the core-mantle boundary (a result of Hide); (2) depth to the current and motion sources responsible for the planetary dynamo; (3) presence or absence of small-scale turbulence in the upper reaches of the core; (4) large-scale horizontal fluid motion at the top of the core; (5) strength of horizontal currents, zonal magnetic fields, Coriolis and Lorentz forces at the top of the core; and (6) current system in the mantle and strength of electromagnetic core-mantle coupling.}

  abstract = {SUMMARY Using the 2-D DC-resistivity tomography experiment as an example, we examine some of the difficulties inherently associated with constructing a single maximally smooth model as a solution to a geophysical inverse problem. We argue that this conventional approach yields at best only a single model from a myriad, of possible models and at worst produces a model which, although having minimum structure, frequently has little useful relation to the earth that gave rise to the observed data. In fact in applied geophysics it is usual to have significant prior information which is to be supplemented by further geophysical experiments. With, this perspective we suggest an alternate approach to geophysical inverse problems which emphasizes the prior information and includes the data from the geophysical experiment as a supplementary constraint. To this end we take all available prior information and construct an inversion algorithm which, given an arbitrary starting model and the absence of any data, will produce a preconceived earth model and then introduce the observed data into the inversion to determine how the prior earth model is influenced by the supplementary geophysical data.}

Geophysical inversions such as impedance inversion, amplitude-variation-with-offset inversion, and traveltime tomography are commonly used in the industry to yield physical properties from measured seismic data. Machine learning, a data-driven approach, has become popular during the past decades and is useful for solving such inverse problems. An advantage of machine learning methods is that they can be implemented without knowledge of physical equations or theories. The challenges of machine learning lie in acquiring enough training data and selecting relevant parameters, which are essential in obtaining a good quality model. In this study, we compare geophysical inversion and machine learning approaches in solving inverse problems and show similarities and differences of these approaches in a mathematical form and numerical tests. Both methods aid in solving ill-posed and nonlinear problems and use similar optimization techniques. We take reflectivity inversion as an example of the inverse problem. We apply geophysical inversion based on the least-squares method and artificial neural networks as a machine learning approach to solve reflectivity inversion using 2D synthetic data sets and 3D field data sets. A neural network with multiple hidden layers successfully generates the nonlinear mapping function to predict reflectivity. For this inverse problem, we test different L1 regularizers for both approaches. L1 regularization alleviates effects of noise in seismic traces and enhances sparsity, especially in the least-squares method. The 2D synthetic wedge model and field data examples show that neural networks yield high spatial resolution.}

When the system is unknown, it can be estimated, together with the noise variance, by using a stochastic version of EM algorithm.

The main goal of this paper is to propose a step forward toward such a framework, focussing on the discrete inverse problems, that are used in practical applications. The relevance of information and measurements (real world data) for the definition of the calibration target and of the objective function is discussed, in particular with reference to the Bayesian approach. Identifiability of model parameters, posedness (uniqueness and stability) and conditioning of the inverse problems are formally defined. The proposed framework is so general as to permit rigorous definitions and treatment of sensitivity analysis, adjoint-state approach, multi-objective optimization.}

  abstract = {An important aspect of the physical sciences is to make inferences about physical parameters from data. In general, the laws of physics provide the means for computing the data values given a model. This is called the “forward problem”, see figure 1. In the inverse problem, the aim is to reconstruct the model from a set of measurements. In the ideal case, an exact theory exists that prescribes how the data should be transformed in order to reproduce the model. For some selected examples such a theory exists assuming that the required infinite and noise-free data sets would be available. A quantum mechanical potential in one spatial dimension can be reconstructed when the reflection coefficient is known for all energies [Marchenko, 1955; Burridge, 1980]. This technique can be generalized for the reconstruction of a quantum mechanical potential in three dimensions [Newton, 1989], but in that case a redundant data set is required for reasons that are not well understood. The mass-density in a one-dimensional string can be constructed from the measurements of all eigenfrequencies of that string [Borg,1946], but due to the symmetry of this problem only the even part of the mass-density can be determined. If the seismic velocity in the earth depends only on depth, the velocity can be constructed exactly from the measurement of the arrival time as a function of distance of seismic waves using an Abel transform [Herglotz, 1907; Wiechert, 1907]. Mathematically this problem is identical to the construction of a spherically symmetric quantum mechanical potential in three dimensions [Keller et al., 1956]. However, the construction method of Herglotz-Wiechert only gives an unique result when the velocity increases monotonically with depth [Gerver and Markushevitch, 1966]. This situation is similar in quantum mechanics where a radially symmetric potential can only be constructed uniquely when the potential does not have local minima [Sabatier, 1973].}

A Backus-Gilbert type tradeoff curve is constructed for the problem of estimating the solution to the linear system in the presence of noise. It is shown that the stochastic inverse represents an optimal point on this tradeoff curve.

Instead of using regularization methods to constrain the non-uniqueness of geophysical inverse problems, we confront directly the non-uniqueness and attempt to describe it. The basic technique is to generate and describe a collection of models that fit the data within acceptable limits based upon observational errors. This collection of models, called an ensemble, is analysed with statistical methods in order to characterize the uncertainty in the solution and also make inferences about properties that are shared by all acceptable models. A by-product of this approach is that it produces basic information about the degree of linearity contained in the problem and maps trade-offs between various parameters. The method proposed is quite general and should be applicable to a broad range of geophysical inverse problems. We illustrate the basic method by applying it to two typical geophysical problems. The first application is to a set of cross-borehole traveltime observations gathered in Kesterson, California. The small deviations of the observed traveltime residuals from those predicted by a uniform half-space indicates that the velocity contrasts are not large. The set of acceptable models appears to form a non-degenerate hyperellipsoid in the model space. The mean of the velocity models converges quite rapidly to a smoothed version of a linearized singular-value decomposition solution. The velocity variations agree very well with the results of a hydrological tracer test conducted prior to the seismic experiment. The second application is to the problem of simultaneously estimating the shape and density of a constant density body using surface gravity measurements. In this case a linear analysis is found to be inadequate. A quadratic formulation is necessary to accurately represent the trade-off between the magnitude of the density perturbation and the depth extent of the body.}

  abstract = {Many geophysical inverse problems derive from governing partial differential equations with unknown coefficients. Alternatively, inverse problems often arise from integral equations associated with a Green’s function solution to a governing differential equation. In their discrete form such equations reduce to systems of polynomial equations, known as algebraic equations. Using techniques from computational algebra one can address questions of the existence of solutions to such equations as well as the uniqueness of the solutions. The techniques are enumerative and exhaustive, requiring a finite number of computer operations. For example, calculating a bound to the total number of solutions reduces to computing the dimension of a linear vector space. The solution set itself may be constructed through the solution of an eigenvalue problem. The techniques are applied to a set of synthetic magnetotelluric values generated by conductivity variations within a layer. We find that the estimation of the conductivity and the electric field in the subsurface, based upon single-frequency magnetotelluric field values, is equivalent to a linear inverse problem. The techniques are also illustrated by an application to a magnetotelluric data set gathered at Battle Mountain, Nevada. Surface observations of the electric (Ey) and magnetic (Hx) fields are used to construct a model of subsurface electrical structure. Using techniques for algebraic equations it is shown that solutions exist, and that the set of solutions is finite. The total number of solutions is bounded above at 134 217 728. A numerical solution of the algebraic equations generates a conductivity structure in accordance with the current geological model for the area.}

The imaging methods attempt to provide an image of the defect at variance of commercial instruments that, generally, detect the defect and may have limited capabilities of extracting its major sizes by means of calibration curves obtained in predened conditions. In addition, numerical models of the probe-defect interaction (direct problem) play a relevant role for the computer aided design of the probe, where commercial codes typically fail to treat this kind of problems. In this thesis we present methods for the solution of both the direct and the inverse problems in ECT. The methods have been developed ad-hoc for ECT and have been optimized for accuracy and speed in view of real-time applications.}

The presence of ferromagnetic materials (the steel bars of the reinforcement) immersed in the concrete disturbs the magnetic field at the surface of the structure. These field alterations are detected by sensors coils placed on the concrete surface. Variations in position and cross section (the size) of steel bars immersed in concrete originate slightly different values for the induced voltages at the coils. . The values for the induced voltages were obtained in laboratory tests, and multi-layer perceptron artificial neural networks with Levemberg-Marquardt training algorithm were used to identify the location and size of the bar.

Therefore, non-destructive methods like radioscopy, ultrasound, optical or thermal imaging increasingly gain in importance with respect to ongoing product and material development in the different phases like material characterization, production control or module reliability testing. Because of the manifold different application fields, i.e., certain physical NDT methods applied to material inspection, characterization or reliability testing, this contribution will focus on the radioscopic-based methods related to their most important applications. Today, in modern industrial quality control, X-ray transmission is used in two different ways: • Two-dimensional radioscopic transmission imaging (projection technique), usually applied to inline inspection tasks in application fields like lightweight material production, electronic component soldering or food production. • Computed tomography (CT) for generation of three-dimensional data, representing spatial information and density distribution of objects. CT application fields are on the one hand the understanding of production process failure or component and module inspection (completeness) and on the other hand the dimensional measuring of hidden geometrical outlines (metrology). This paper demonstrates the methods including technical set-ups (X-ray source and detector), imaging and reconstruction results and the methods for high speed and high-resolution volume data generation and evaluation.}

As a matter of fact, the latter task can be accomplished with rather simple inverse algorithms, which rely on the linearization of the elastic and/or electromagnetic wave inverse scattering problem. Nevertheless, in particular in safety relevant applications like nuclear power generation, aircraft and/or bridge testing, one is interested to extract the maximum amount of information from the data utilizing all a priori knowledge of the physical model under concern, for instance with regard to the propagation characteristics of the defect embedding medium or with regard to the polarization of the wave mode. In that sense, some recent fundamental improvements of linear diffraction tomographic inverse scattering have been made, which will be summarized and commented upon in the present article. In addition, a novel philosophy of computer aided nondestructive testing will be discussed, which comes under the alias ULIAS: Ultrasonic Inspection Applying Simulation. The key idea is to support the assessment of the output of existing imaging algorithms with simulations applying numerical techniques to compute wave propagation and scattering for the testing problem under concern; the resulting synthetic data supply a testbed for the inverse problem.}

Thus, the main objective of this paper is to review the main NDT techniques and assess the capability of detecting WAAM defects, for inspection either in a monitoring, in-process or post-process scenario. Radiography and ultrasonic testing were experimentally tested on reference specimens in order to compare the techniques capabilities. Metallographic, hardness and electrical conductivity analysis were also applied to the same specimens for material characterization. Experimental outcomes prove that typical WAAM defects can be detected by the referred techniques.

  abstract = {For decades, aircraft disasters have always been a concern for airline companies and especially for consumers. Scientists all over the world have been constantly trying to study, discover and invent new methods for testing and prevention to reduce future aircraft accidents. One of those methods is non-destructive testing, which is a widely adaptive process for analyzing structural integrity over wide arrays of object. X-rays, ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) are non-destructive testing applications commonly used for the commercial aircraft maintenance. These non-destructive testing methods for aircraft structures give us high-quality images of structural damage but, there are some disadvantages related to resolution and the contrast mechanism of the image. The goal of this study is to demonstrate the concept of X-Ray Induced Acoustic Computed Tomography (XACT) imaging method for defect detection and localization through simulations using k-wave MATLAB toolbox. XACT is a technique based on the X-ray induced acoustic effect. In XACT, a short pulsed of X-rays are required to achieve thermal response and generate acoustic waves. X-ray travels to an object, the photons are absorbed causing the temperature in the object to raise, which generates acoustic waves due to thermoelastic expansion. These acoustic waves are then detected by ultrasonic transducers. Within the fuselage of the aircraft, the aircraft’s stiffener is designed using SolidWorks. along with two different types of defects through voids due to manufacturing imperfection process. As well as, cracks in the surface of the model due to mechanical failures are created in MATLAB. Two properties of Aluminum 6065 and Inconel 625 materials were selected for our simulation study since it is often used for the fuselage and/or aircraft engines. XACT images are generated under the combination of high X-ray absorption and ultrasonic transducers that will be able to overcome the disadvantages of the X-ray imaging technique and ultrasound imaging technique in image resolution and contrast mechanisms. The results from this simulation study demonstrate that the XACT method not only gives us high-resolution images but moreover, higher contrast of images that also allows us to detect position accuracy of the cons created.},

The suggested methodology of the inverse problem tcchnique seems promising for estimating material properties but requires that: (I) All measurements errors must be known; (2) The (measured) signals itself should deliver enough input power into the system; (3) The simulated objeeti\textbackslash 'e data should be sensitive enough for changes in material properties.}

We establish a first-order linear partial differential equation relating the assigned family of light rays with all possible refractive indexes compatible with this family.

  abstract = {Abstract Three classes of inverse coefficient problems arising in engineering mechanics and computational material science are considered. Mathematical models of all considered problems are proposed within the J2-deformation theory of plasticity. The first class is related to the determination of unknown elastoplastic properties of a beam from a limited number of torsional experiments. The inverse problem here consists of identifying the unknown coefficient g ( ξ 2 ) (plasticity function) in the non-linear differential equation of torsional creep  ( g ( | u | 2 ) u x 1 ) x 1  ( g ( | u | 2 ) u x 2 ) x 2 = 2 φ , x Ω R 2 , from the torque (or torsional rigidity) T ( φ ) , given experimentally. The second class of inverse problems is related to the identification of elastoplastic properties of a 3D body from spherical indentation tests. In this case one needs to determine unknown Lame coefficients in the system of PDEs of non-linear elasticity, from the measured spherical indentation loading curve P = P ( α ) , obtained during the quasi-static indentation test. In the third model an inverse problem of identifying the unknown coefficient g ( ξ 2 ( u ) ) in the non-linear bending equation is analyzed. The boundary measured data here is assumed to be the deflections w i [ τ k ] w ( λ i ; τ k ) , measured during the quasi-static bending process, given by the parameter τ k , k = 1 , K ̄  , at some points λ i = ( x 1 ( i ) , x 2 ( i ) ) , i = 1 , M ̄  of a plate. An existence of weak solutions of all direct problems are derived in appropriate Sobolev spaces, by using monotone potential operator theory. Then monotone iteration schemes for all the linearized direct problems are proposed. Strong convergence of solutions of the linearized problems, as well as rates of convergence is proved. Based on obtained continuity property of the direct problem solution with respect to coefficients, and compactness of the set of admissible coefficients, an existence of quasi-solutions of all considered inverse problems is proved. Some numerical results, useful from the points of view of engineering mechanics and computational material science, are demonstrated.}

  abstract = {We use the problem of determining nematic liquid crystal director profiles from optical measurements as an example to illustrate that what is often treated purely as a data fitting problem is really an inverse problem and that useful insights can be obtained by treating it in this way. Specifically we illustrate the analysis of the sufficiency of data and the sensitivity of a solution to measurement errors. We assume a stratified medium where the Berreman method can be used for the optical forward problem and we consider the inverse problem to be the determination of an anisotropic dielectric permittivity tensor from optical data. A numerical singular value decomposition (SVD) analysis reveals that although this inverse problem is severely ill-conditioned it is possible to determine depth-dependent information provided the medium is sufficiently birefringent and that, as one might expect, a larger range of incident angles gives greater information. Analytical solutions of the Berreman equations for general perturbations of an orthorhombic crystal confirm the uniqueness of solution for the linearized problem and give further insights into the severely ill-posed nature of the inverse problem.}

Unfortunately, numerous factors render this process labour intensive and error prone. Experimental conditions, such as high pressure or structural metastability, often complicate characterization. Furthermore, many materials of great modern interest, such as batteries and hydrogen storage media, contain light elements such as Li and H that only weakly scatter X-rays. Finally, structural refinements generally require significant human input and intuition, as they rely on good initial guesses for the target structure. To address these many challenges, we demonstrate a new hybrid approach, first-principles-assisted structure solution (FPASS), which combines experimental diffraction data, statistical symmetry information and first-principles-based algorithmic optimization to automatically solve crystal structures. We demonstrate the broad utility of FPASS to clarify four important crystal structure debates: the hydrogen storage candidates MgNH and NH(3)BH(3); Li(2)O(2), relevant to Li-air batteries; and high-pressure silane, SiH(4).}

  abstract = {THE prediction of the structure of inorganic crystalline solids from the knowledge of their chemical composition is still a largely unresolved problem1–3. The usual approach to this problem is to minimize, for a selection of candidate models, the potential energy of the system with respect to the structural parameters of these models: the solution is the arrangement that comes out lowest in energy. Methods using this procedure may differ in the origin (ab initio or empirical) of the interatomic potentials used, but they usually restrict themselves to optimizing a structural arrangement within the constraints of given symmetry and bond topology. As a result, they do not truly address the problem of predicting the unknown structure of a real compound. The method we describe here is an attempt at solving the following problem: given the chemical composition of a crystalline compound and the values of its unit-cell parameters, find its structure (topology and bond distances) by optimizing the arrangement of ions, atoms or molecules in accordance with a set of prescribed rules. The procedure uses simple, empirical crystal chemistry arguments (Pauling's principles for ionic compounds4) and a powerful stochastic search procedure, known as simulated annealing5 to identify the best atomic model or models. We discuss the potential of the method for structure determination and refinement, using results obtained for several known inorganic structures, and by the determination of a previously unknown structure. Although the approach is limited to the case of inorganic compounds, it is nevertheless very general, and would apply to any crystalline structure provided that the principles governing the architecture of the solid can be properly described.}

However, these methods have limitations, either in accessibly (domain expertise), accuracy, and/or throughput \&nbsp;[1]. Consequently, the material search space remains underexplored, given order 10⁵ reported compounds compared to order 10¹⁰ theorized ternary compounds [2]. To accelerate the exploration of new solid-state materials, a framework capable of inverse design for materials with user-defined properties is needed. Herein, we present a generalized framework for inverse design of crystals with user-defined properties, which include both ground-state and excited-state properties (\emph{e.g.}, thermoelectric power factor) using sparsely labelled training data. The key enabler of this inverse-design framework is a general and invertible crystallographic representation that encodes the crystallographic information into the representations in both real space and reciprocal space. The trained surrogate model achieves similar property prediction accuracy and precision as DFT calculations within seconds. Using the developed inverse-design framework, we design 79 new crystals with user-targeted formation energies, 17 crystals with targeted bandgap, and 27 crystals for potential thermoelectric applications. The compositions of those designed materials are unique and cannot be found in the training or test sets. We validate our predictions using first-principle calculations. Toward bridging the gap between simulation and experiment, we demonstrate a naïve synthesizability metric — predicting the existence of an ICSD record — and show this methodology can, in principle, include stability and/or synthesizability as a target metric, once consensus metrics are agreed upon by the field.}

Crystal structure prediction is a necessary step for assessing theoretically the stability of a hypothetical material and, therefore, is a crucial step in inverse materials design protocols. Here, we describe how biologically-inspired global optimization methods can efficiently predict the stable crystal structure of solids. Specifically, we discuss the application of genetic algorithms to search for optimal atom configurations in systems in which the underlying lattice is given, and of evolutionary algorithms to address the general lattice-type prediction problem.}

  abstract = {Radiotherapy is an important clinical tool to fight malignancies. To do so, a key point consists in selecting a suitable radiation dose that could achieve tumour control without inducing significant damage to surrounding healthy tissues. In spite of recent significant advances, any radiotherapy planning in use relies principally on experience-based decisions made by clinicians among several possible choices. In this work we consider a mathematical problem related to that decision-making process. More precisely, we assume that a well-defined target region, called planning target volume (PTV), is given. We then consider the question of determining which radiation distribution is able to achieve a maximum impact on tumour cells and a minimum one in healthy ones. Such dose distribution is defined as the solution of a multi-parameter minimization problem over the PTV and healthy tissues, subject to a number of constraints arising from clinical and technical requirements. For any choice of parameters, sufficient conditions for the existence of a unique solution of that problem are derived. Such solution is then approximated by means of a suitable numerical algorithm. Finally, some examples are considered, on which the dependence on model parameters of different clinical efficiency indexes is discussed.}

  abstract = {Radiation therapy concerns the delivery of the proper dose of radiation to a tumor volume without causing irreparable damage to healthy tissue and critical organs. The forward problem refers to calculating the dose distribution that would be delivered to a measured patient cross-section when the radiation field generated by the beam sources is specified. The inverse problem refers to calculating the radiation field that will provide a specified dose distribution in the patient. The forward and inverse problems of radiation-therapy treatment planning are first formulated in their continuous versions, and the point is made that, in this field of application, the inverse problem calls for the inversion of an operator for which no analytic closed-form mathematical representation exists. To attack the inverse problem under such circumstances, a discretized model is set up in which both patient section and radiation field are finely discretized. This leads to a linear feasibility problem, which is solved by a relaxation method. The paper includes full details of this new approach, with discussion of technical aspects such as dose apportionment, software development, and experimental results. Consequences and limitations as well as a precise comparison with other methodologies are also discussed.}

  abstract = {In radiation therapy one is confronted with the task of formulating a treatment plan which delivers a specified dose to a tumour but avoids irreparable damage to surrounding uninvolved structures. Radiation therapy treatment planning (RTTP) involves an inverse and a forward problem. The inverse problem is to devise a treatment plan, i.e. a radiation beam configuration and beam weighting, which provides a specified dose distribution to the delineated region. The forward problem is to calculate the dose distribution within the patient that results from the weighted radiation beam configuration. Since no analytic closed-form mathematical formulation of the forward operator exists, the inverse problem actually calls for computerised inversion of data. This inversion is achieved by constructing a fully discretised model that leads to a system of linear inequalities. These inequalities are solved either by a row-action method or a block-Cimmino algorithm which allows the assignment of weights within each block of inequalities.}

Traditional treatment plans assume that the target structure remains in a fixed location throughout treatment. However, many studies have shown that because of organ motion, inconsistencies in patient positioning over the weeks of treatment, etc, the tumour location is not stationary. We present a probabilistic model for the IMRT inverse problem and show that it is identical to using robust optimization techniques, under certain assumptions. For a sample prostate case, our computational results show that this method is computationally feasible and promising—compared to traditional methods, our model has the potential to find treatment plans that are more adept at sparing healthy tissue while maintaining the prescribed dose to the target.}

  abstract = {AbstractFor some decades radiation therapy - external beam radiation therapy as well as brachytherapy - has been proved successful in cancer treatment. It is the major task of clinical radiation treatment planning to realise on the one hand a high level dose of radiation in the cancer tissue in order to obtain maximum tumour control. On the other hand it is obvious that it is absolutely necessary to keep in the tissue outside the tumour, particularly in organs at risk, the unavoidable radiation as low as possible. No doubt, these two objectives of treatment planning – high level dose in the tumour, low radiation outside the tumour – have a basically contradictory nature. Therefore, it is no surprise that inverse mathematical models with prescribed dose distributions tend to be infeasible in most cases. Thus, there is need for approximations compromising between overdosing the organs at risk and underdosing the target volume. Differing from the currently used time consuming iterative approach, which measures deviation from an ideal (non-achievable) treatment plan using recursively trial-and-error weights for the organs of interest, we go a new way trying to avoid a priori weight choices and consider the treatment planning problem as a multiple objective linear programming problem: with each organ of interest, target tissue as well as organs at risk, we associate an objective function measuring the maximal deviation from the prescribed doses. We build up a data base of relatively few efficient solutions representing and approximating the variety of Pareto solutions of the multiple objective linear programming problem. This data base can be easily scanned by physicians looking for an adequate treatment plan with the aid of an appropriate online tool.},

  abstract = {Abstract Radiotherapy (RT) is among the regular techniques for the treatment of cancerous tumours. Many of cancer patients are treated by this manner. Treatment planning is the most important phase in RT and it plays a key role in therapy quality achievement. As the goal of RT is to irradiate the tumour with adequately high levels of radiation while sparing neighbouring healthy tissues as much as possible, it is a multi-objective problem naturally. In this study, we propose an agent-based model of vascular tumour growth and also effects of RT. Next, we use multi-objective distributed Q-learning algorithm to find Pareto-optimal solutions for calculating RT dynamic dose. We consider multiple objectives and each group of optimizer agents attempt to optimise one of them, iteratively. At the end of each iteration, agents compromise the solutions to shape the Pareto-front of multi-objective problem. We propose a new approach by defining three schemes of treatment planning created based on different combinations of our objectives namely invasive, conservative and moderate. In invasive scheme, we enforce killing cancer cells and pay less attention about irradiation effects on normal cells. In conservative scheme, we take more care of normal cells and try to destroy cancer cells in a less stressed manner. The moderate scheme stands in between. For implementation, each of these schemes is handled by one agent in MDQ-learning algorithm and the Pareto optimal solutions are discovered by the collaboration of agents. By applying this methodology, we could reach Pareto treatment plans through building different scenarios of tumour growth and RT. The proposed multi-objective optimisation algorithm generates robust solutions and finds the best treatment plan for different conditions.}

The probability of accomplishing complication-free tumour control is maximized by an iterative algorithm. The algorithm is demonstrated by applying it to a one-dimensional (1D) tumour model, and also to a more clinically relevant 2D case. The new algorithm is n-dimensional so it could simultaneously optimize the dose delivery in a 3D volume and in principle also select the ideal beam orientations, beam modalities (photons, electrons, neutrons, etc.) and optimal spectral distributions of the corresponding modalities. To make calculation time reasonable, 2D-3D problems are most practical, and suitable beam orientations are preselected by the choice of irradiation kernel. The energy deposition kernel should therefore be selected in order to avoid irradiation through organs at risk. Clinically established dose response parameters for the tissues of interest are used to make the optimization as relevant as possible to the clinical problems at hand.}

  abstract = {Abstract. Radiation therapy planning is often a tight rope walk between dangerous insufficient dose in the target volume and life threatening overdosing of organs at risk. Finding ideal balances between these inherently contradictory goals challenges dosimetrists and physicians in their daily practice. Todays inverse planning systems calculate treatment plans based on a single evaluation function that measures the quality of a radiation treatment plan. Unfortunately, such a one dimensional approach cannot satisfactorily map the different backgrounds of physicians and the patient dependent necessities. So, too often a time consuming iterative optimization process between evaluation of the dose distribution and redefinition of the evaluation function is needed. In this paper we propose a generic multi-criteria approach based on Pareto's solution concept. For each entity of interest – target volume or organ at risk – a structure dependent evaluation function is defined measuring deviations from ideal doses that are calculated from statistical functions. A reasonable bunch of clinically meaningful Pareto optimal solutions are stored in a data base, which can be interactively searched by physicians. The system guarantees dynamic planning as well as the discussion of tradeoffs between different entities. Mathematically, we model the inverse problem as a multi-criteria linear programming problem. Because of the large scale nature of the problem it is not possible to solve the problem in a 3D-setting without adaptive reduction by appropriate approximation schemes. Our approach is twofold: First, the discretization of the continuous problem results from an adaptive hierarchical clustering process which is used for a local refinement of constraints during the optimization procedure. Second, the set of Pareto optimal solutions is approximated by an adaptive grid of representatives that are found by a hybrid process of calculating extreme compromises and interpolation methods.}

This makes it possible to calculate the optimal incident beam profiles required to produce the desired dose distribution in the target volume by solving an integral equation with an iterative algorithm. The major advantage, compared with conventional treatment planning, is that the trial and error part is avoided, and replaced by a deterministic calculation of the optimal treatment plan. In the present paper this algorithm is briefly described and compared with experimental results and an analytical inversion formula which is valid for a cylindrical geometry. The experiments were performed with non-homogeneous beams shaped with compensators designed using the algorithm. The agreement between the experimental results and the predictions of the algorithm are quite good, generally within about 5\%. The differences are caused by discretization noise due to the finite resolution of the calculation matrix, imperfections in the experimental situation, and by the assumption of spatial invariant dose distribution kernels.}

It is shown that the solution generated by the algorithm is the closest possible dose distribution to the desired dose distribution under these constraints. The linear convergence of the rather crude gradient method with fixed-step length is compensated by the fact that fast Fourier transform techniques can be used to speed up the calculations.

METHODS AND MATERIALS An algorithm, based on the inverse technique, has been integrated into the radiotherapy treatment-planning computer system in our Center. This method of computer-assisted treatment design was used to derive intensity-modulated beams to optimize the boost portion of the treatment plan for a patient with a T1c cancer of the prostate. A dose of 72 Gy (in 40 fractions) was given with a six-field plan, and an additional 9 Gy (in five fractions) with six intensity-modulated beams. The intensity-modulated fields were delivered using dynamic multileaf collimation, that is, individual leaves were in motion during radiation delivery, with the treatment machine operating in the clinical mode. Exhaustive quality assurance measurement and monitoring were carried out to ensure safe and accurate implementation. RESULTS Dose distribution and dose-volume histogram of the "inverse method" boost plan and of the composite (72 Gy primary + 9 Gy boost) plan were judged clinically acceptable. Compared to a manually designed boost plan, the inverse treatment design gave improved conformality and increased dose homogeneity in the planning target volume. Film and ion chamber dosimetry, performed prior to the first treatment, indicated that each of the six intensity-modulated fields was accurately produced. Thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) measurements performed on the patient confirmed that the intended dose was delivered in the treatment. In addition, computer-aided treatment-monitoring programs assured that the multileaf collimator (MLC) position file was executed to the specified precision. In terms of the overall radiation treatment process, there will likely be labor savings in the planning and the treatment phases. CONCLUSIONS We have placed into clinical use an integrated system of conformal radiation treatment that incorporated the inverse method of treatment design and the use of dynamic multileaf collimation to deliver intensity-modulated beams. The system can provide better treatment design, which can be implemented reliably and safely. We are hopeful that improved treatment efficacy will result.}

  abstract = {Abstract.Approximately 40\% of all U.S. cancer cases are treated with radiation therapy. In Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) the treatment planning problem is to choose external beam angles and their corresponding intensity maps (showing how the intensity varies across a given beam) to maximize tumor dose subject to the tolerances of surrounding healthy tissues. Dose, like temperature, is a quantity defined at each point in the body, and the distribution of dose is determined by the choice of treatment parameters available to the planner. In addition to absolute dose limits in healthy tissues, some tissues have at least one dose-volume restriction that requires a fraction of its volume to not exceed a specified tighter threshold level for damage. There may also be a homogeneity limit for the tumor that restricts the allowed spread of dose across its volume. We formulate this planning problem as a mixed integer program over a coupled pair of column generation processes – one designed to produce intensity maps, and a second specifying protected area choices for tissues under dose-volume restrictions. The combined procedure is shown to strike a balance between computing an approximately optimal solution and bounding its maximum possible suboptimality that we believe holds promise for implementations able to offer the power and flexibility of mixed-integer linear programming models on instances of practical scale.}

Its objective is to make the dose conform to the tumor and spare other organs. Instead of resorting to the rather complex inverse-planning, the technique described here is an extension of the conventional treatment planning technique. The beam orientation and wedge angles are chosen in the conventional rule-based manner. However, within each conformal beam's eye view (BEV) field including margin, a number of sub-field openings are added. The smaller field openings are designed to irradiate the tumor, while sparing the normal tissue of the organs at risk (OARs) that intrude into the target region in the BEV. As the number of intrusions into the target BEV increases, the number of sub-fields for each beam increases. The Cimmino simultaneous projection method was employed to obtain the optimized weighting for each field of each beam. In cases where the dose constraints for the tumor and for the OARs are reasonable, it is possible to obtain a plan with a fairly small number of beams that satisfies the specified dose objectives. This is illustrated for the treatment of prostate cancer, where the rectum creates a concavity in the planning target volume. An advantage of this technique is that the quality assurance for the delivery of these plans does not require extensive special efforts.}

  abstract = {We have developed a new axisymmetric solution for the numerical simulation of single-phase fluid flow in permeable media. In this new solution, the governing parabolic partial differential equation (PDE) is transformed into a linear operator problem that is subsequently solved with an Extended Krylov Subspace Method (EKSM). The algorithm yields solutions for pressure at a multitude of times with the same efficiency of that of a single-time solution. Extensive comparisons with analytical solutions show that our simulator yields pressure results with accuracies better than 1\%, and favorably competes with commercial simulators in CPU execution times and memory efficiency. Examples of numerical simulation are considered for water injection and variable flow-rate problems. In both cases, we have focused our attention to the description of pressure data acquired with permanent sensors deployed in direct hydraulic contact with the producing formation. The inverse problem considered in this paper consists of mapping time and space variations of pressure and flow rate into a local distribution of permeabilities. We solve this inverse problem by minimizing a cost function written as the sum of the square differences between the measured pressure data and the corresponding pressure data yielded by our Krylov subspace simulator. A nonlinear Gauss-Newton fixedpoint iteration search is used to minimize the quadratic cost function. We also test a dual coarseand fine-grid approach to accelerate the solution of the inverse problem. Examples of inversion are shown with noise-free and noisy data aimed at understanding the role played by the flow-rate function and the location, spacing, and number of permanent sensors into the accuracy and stability of the inverted permeability values. Introduction The availability of permanently installed downhole pressure and temperature sensors has opened a new window of opportunities to probe hydrocarbon reservoirs. A continuous stream of time-domain data is now available to perform realtime monitoring of the variation of fluid-flow parameters resulting from production. In turn, time-domain monitoring provides the basic hardware for a much-needed active feedback loop to control hydrocarbon production in real time. Very recently, prototypes of permanent sensors have been constructed to be deployed behind casing and hence to be in direct contact with the producing formations. When commercially available, these in-situ sensors will allow the possibility of delivering real-time images of the spatial distribution of fluid-flow parameters in the vicinity of a well and also between existing wells. Interpretation work is therefore in order to quantify how a variation in the measurements acquired by in-situ permanent sensors will translate into a variation in the spatial distribution of fluidflow properties. It is also imperative to optimally design the spacing and number of permanent sensors in light of existing reservoir conditions and potentially deleterious noisy measurements. The work described in this paper is an attempt to quantify the spatial resolution properties of in-situ permanent pressure measurements. To do so, we consider a hypothetical water injection experiment and make use of the extensive body of estimation techniques available from the field of geophysical inverse theory. Our goal is to construct an efficient algorithm to quantify the sensitivity of permanent pressure data to lateral and vertical variations in the distribution of permeability around the injection well. In the past, several nonlinear optimization procedures have been applied to solve inverse problems in petroleum engineering and ground water hydrology studies. Jacquard and Jain presented the first numerical algorithm for the estimation of two-dimensional (2D) permeability variations from pressure measurements. Later, Carter et al. developed an SPE 71612 Numerical Simulation and Inversion of Pressure Data Acquired With Permanent Sensors Faruk O. Alpak, SPE, Carlos Torres-Verdín, SPE, and Kamy Sepehrnoori, SPE, The University of Texas at Austin 2 F.O. ALPAK, C. TORRES-VERDÍN, K. SEPEHRNOORI SPE 71612 efficient method to calculate sensitivity coefficients for 2D single-phase flow. He et al. extended Carter’s method to 3D geometries. Likewise, Chen et al. and Chavent et al. made use of a least-squares formulation based on adjoint operators to compute the gradient of the objective function with respect to the model parameters. In the ground water literature, Carrera and Neuman used an optimal control method to estimate fluid-flow parameters of aquifers. Quite recently, Wu developed an efficient Newton-Raphson nonlinear inversion technique for mapping multiphase production data into distributions of permeability and fluid saturations. The inversion algorithm employed in this paper to evaluate permanent pressure data is based on an efficient least squares minimization technique adapted from the work of TorresVerdín et al.. We also implement a novel dual finitedifference gridding approach to accelerate the inversion associated with a large number of unknown parameters. A Spectral Lanczos Decomposition Method (SLDM) is used to simulate numerically the single-phase pressure data acquired by the permanent sensors. An important feature of the SLDM algorithm is that pressures can be simulated for a multitude of times with almost the same computer efficiency as that of one single time simulation (Knizhnerman et al. and Druskin and Knizhnerman). Our paper concludes with several examples of parametric inversion drawn from the interpretation of pressure, pressure derivative, and flow-rate data acquired with in-situ permanent sensors, and simulated numerically under the assumption of 2D axisymmetric spatial variations of permeability around an injection well.

Standard inverse identification procedures solve the model for a choice of the model parameters, and then parameters are updated trying to minimize the gap between the model predictions and some available experimental measures. Thus, the model has to be evaluated for each trial set of the model parameters. When models involve a great number of degrees of freedom the identification procedure becomes a computationally expensive task. In this paper we propose a new procedure able to solve once the model for any value of the model parameters. For this purpose, all the model parameters are considered as extra-coordinates of the model. Thus, the model results finally defined in a multidimensional space including the physical space x, the time t and a number of extra-coordinates related to the model parameters.

  abstract = {In this paper we establish a mathematical framework for a range of inverse problems for functions, given a finite set of noisy observations. The problems are hence underdetermined and are often ill-posed. We study these problems from the viewpoint of Bayesian statistics, with the resulting posterior probability measure being defined on a space of functions. We develop an abstract framework for such problems which facilitates application of an infinite-dimensional version of Bayes theorem, leads to a well-posedness result for the posterior measure (continuity in a suitable probability metric with respect to changes in data), and also leads to a theory for the existence of maximizing the posterior probability (MAP) estimators for such Bayesian inverse problems on function space. A central idea underlying these results is that continuity properties and bounds on the forward model guide the choice of the prior measure for the inverse problem, leading to the desired results on well-posedness and MAP estimators; the PDE analysis and probability theory required are thus clearly dileneated, allowing a straightforward derivation of results. We show that the abstract theory applies to some concrete applications of interest by studying problems arising from data assimilation in fluid mechanics. The objective is to make inference about the underlying velocity field, on the basis of either Eulerian or Lagrangian observations. We study problems without model error, in which case the inference is on the initial condition, and problems with model error in which case the inference is on the initial condition and on the driving noise process or, equivalently, on the entire time-dependent velocity field. In order to undertake a relatively uncluttered mathematical analysis we consider the two-dimensional Navier–Stokes equation on a torus. The case of Eulerian observations—direct observations of the velocity field itself—is then a model for weather forecasting. The case of Lagrangian observations—observations of passive tracers advected by the flow—is then a model for data arising in oceanography. The methodology which we describe herein may be applied to many other inverse problems in which it is of interest to find, given observations, an infinite-dimensional object, such as the initial condition for a PDE. A similar approach might be adopted, for example, to determine an appropriate mathematical setting for the inverse problem of determining an unknown tensor arising in a constitutive law for a PDE, given observations of the solution. The paper is structured so that the abstract theory can be read independently of the particular problems in fluid mechanics which are subsequently studied by application of the theory.}

This inverse design method is based on the exact solution of the local Riemann problem on moving blade surfaces. Furthermore, an improved relaxation factor is added to control the induced velocity for reasonable deformation sizes in different cases. The viscous flow analysis and the inverse design are integrated in the computational fluid dynamics software ANSYS Fluent using the dynamic mesh user-defined function, which reduces the time spent on remeshing the computational domain. A compressor cascade is taken to illustrate the effect of this inverse design method. Using the compressor model, the case of a different loading pattern design under a high subsonic flow regime and the case of a loading smooth design under a transonic flow regime have proved the capability of this inverse design method to realize the prescribed pressure loading distribution.}

We introduce a full discrete linearized scheme that is used to compute the gradient of a given cost function by ensuring its consistency.

The third, estimation of fluid velocities from volumetric dye concentration fields, highlights a previously unexplored connection between fluid simulation and proximal algorithms from convex optimization. This connection allows several classical imaging inverse problems to be investigated in the context of fluids, including optical flow, denoising and deconvolution. The connection also allows inverse problems to be incorporated into fluid simulation for the purposes of physically-based regularization of optical flow and for stylistic modifications of fluid captures. Through both methods and all three applications the importance of incorporating domain-specific priors into inverse problems for fluids and imaging is highlighted.}

The forward problem was formulated as a nonlinear partial differential equation and solved by an efficient Galerkin finite element method. The numerical simulator was validated with reference and analytical solutions. The inverse problem was formulated in a nonlinear optimization framework in which model parameters were estimated by minimizing a complex penalty function, representing the discrepancies between the observed and predicted attributes of the physical system. A physical model was designed, built, and operated to collect the experimental datasets needed for model calibration. The proposed strategy was then coupled with the fluid pressure head, fluid content, and fluid flux density time-space series to estimate model parameters. Several optimization scenarios were investigated and it was concluded that while single objective optimization approach has limited accuracy and results in reasonable outputs for one or some attributes of the physical system, the proposed multiobjective optimization shows excellent agreements with the experimental datasets for all state variables.}

The idea is based on the computation of the tissue elasticity distribution. This leads to the inverse elasticity problem; in that, displacement field and boundary conditions are known, and elasticity distribution of the tissue is aimed for computation. We treat this problem by the Gauss–Newton method. This iterative method results in an ill-posed problem, and therefore, regularization schemes are required to deal with this issue. The impacts of the initial guess for tissue elasticity distribution, contrast ratio between elastic modulus of tumor and normal tissue, and noise level of the input data on the estimated solutions are investigated via two different regularization methods. The numerical results show that the accuracy and speed of convergence vary when different regularization methods are applied. Also, the semi-convergence behavior has been observed and discussed. At the end, we signify the necessity of a clever initial guess and intelligent stopping criteria for the iterations. The main purpose here is to highlight some technical factors that have an influence on elasticity image quality and diagnostic accuracy, and we have tried our best to make this article accessible for a broad audience.}

  abstract = {The desire for a diagnostic optical imaging modality has motivated the development of image reconstruction procedures involving solution of the inverse problem. This approach is based on the assumption that, given a set of measurements of transmitted light between pairs of points on the surface of an object, there exists a unique three-dimensional distribution of internal scatterers and absorbers which would yield that set. Thus imaging becomes a task of solving an inverse problem using an appropriate model of photon transport. In this paper we examine the models that have been developed for this task, and review current approaches to image reconstruction. Specifically, we consider models based on radiative transfer theory and its derivatives, which are either stochastic in nature (random walk, Monte Carlo, and Markov processes) or deterministic (partial differential equation models and their solutions). Image reconstruction algorithms are discussed which are based on either direct backprojection, perturbation methods, nonlinear optimization, or Jacobian calculation. Finally we discuss some of the fundamental problems that must be addressed before optical tomography can be considered to be an understood problem, and before its full potential can be realized.}

One is how to determine the three-dimensional anatomy from two or more projections, and the other is to depict organs and struc tures that cannot usually be seen in the films, except by various artificial means. The large part of the very extensive methodology used in diagnostic radiology is devoted to solving these two problems. The spatial reconstruction of the anatomy is usually made intuitively by the radiologist who, by 'three-dimensional thinking', combines two or more images into a spatial concept of the organ under examination. There are many methods designed to aid this reconstruction or to carry it out automatically. Stereo vision may achieve a partially spatial reconstruction, using two projections and possibly special instruments. Conventional tomography is a method that performs a recon struction of a certain layer of the patient, but the reconstruction is incomplete. The inability of conventional diagnostic radiology to discriminate between more than four different materials in the body, namely air, fat, soft tissues, and bones or calcifications, led to the development of a number of contrast media, as well as a large number of ingenious methods of introducing these media into all possible cavities, tubes and vessels in the body in order to decipt them. Certain organs and certain pathologic processes having a different vascularity than the sur rounding tissues and organs, may be demonstrated by angiography. However, this cannot be regarded as a true delineation of the organ itself, but only of its vessels.},

  abstract = {Dynamic medical imaging problems are typically structured as "partial" inverse problems: the desired time series of images (a spatiotemporal matrix) is subject to a purely spatial transformation (its product with a transfer matrix) - so that the forward operator does not address all of the variables of the function to be transformed (analogous to partial differentiation, which is also a partial inverse problem). Given that the transfer matrix is ill-conditioned, the problem of providing the image sequence requires regularization. Under rather general conditions applicable to the setting of partial inverse problems, the regularization parameter of Tikhonov regularization generalizes to a regularization parameter operator, which in proper combination with a standard (spatial) Tikhonov regularizing operator describes the minimum-mean-square-error estimate analogously to that of the Bayesian interpretation of Tikhonov regularization as applied to a "complete" inverse problem. This is in distinction to usual methodology employed for dynamic imaging problems, including usual applications of Tikhonov regularization in this realm, which cannot similarly supply the minimum-mean-square-estimate (under the stated general conditions). The potential power of the implied methodology is illustrated with a numerical example - indicating that substantial improvements in solution estimation are possible.},

  abstract = {Taming unstable inverse problems François Monard This thesis explores two mathematical routes that make the transition from some severely illposed parameter reconstruction problems to better-posed versions of them. The general introduction starts by defining what we mean by an inverse problem and its theoretical analysis. We then provide motivations that come from the field of medical imaging. The first part consists in the analysis of an inverse problem involving the Boltzmann transport equation, with applications in Optical Tomography. There we investigate the reconstruction of the spatially-dependent part of the scattering kernel, from knowledge of angularly averaged outgoing traces of transport solutions and isotropic boundary sources. We study this problem in the stationary regime first, then in the time-harmonic regime. In particular we show, using techniques from functional analysis and stationary phase, that this inverse problem is severely ill-posed in the former setting, whereas it is mildly ill-posed in the latter. In this case, we deduce that making the measurements depend on modulation frequency allows to improve the stability of reconstructions. In the second part, we investigate the inverse problem of reconstructing a tensor-valued conductivity (or diffusion) coefficient in a second-order elliptic partial differential equation, from knowledge of internal measurements of power density type. This problem finds applications in the medical imaging modalities of Electrical Impedance Tomography and Optical Tomography, and the fact that one considers power densities is justified in practice by assuming a coupling of this physical model with ultrasound waves, a coupling assumption that is characteristic of so-called hybrid medical imaging methods. Starting from the famous Caldeŕon’s problem (i.e. the same parameter reconstruction problem from knowledge of boundary fluxes of solutions), and recalling its lack of injectivity and severe instability, we show how going from Dirichletto-Neumann data to considering the power density operator leads to reconstruction of the full conductivity tensor via explicit inversion formulas. Moreover, such reconstruction algorithms only require the loss of either zero or one derivative from the power density functionals to the unknown, depending on what part of the tensor one wants to reconstruct. The inversion formulas are worked out with the help of linear algebra and differential geometry, in particular calculus with the Euclidean connection. The practical pay-off of such theoretical improvements in injectivity and stability is twofold: (i) the lack of injectivity of Calderón’s problem, no longer existing when using power density measurements, implies that future medical imaging modalities such as hybrid methods may make anisotropic properties of human tissues more accessible; (ii) the improvements in stability for both problems in transport and conductivity may yield practical improvements in the resolution of images of the reconstructed coefficients.}

We hope that this classification will guide the curious reader into a discipline with a rich bibliography and sometimes sophisticated mathematics.

The following biomedical imaging modalities are studied: electro/magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG), electrical impedance tomography (EIT), and limited-angle computerized tomography (limited-angle CT). The use of a priori information about the unknown feature is necessary for finding an adequate answer to an inverse problem. Both classical regularization techniques and Bayesian methodology are applied to utilize the a priori knowledge. The inverse problems specifically considered in this work include determination of relatively small electric conductivity anomalies in EIT, dipole-like sources in EEG/MEG, and multiscale X-ray absorbing structures in limited-angle CT. Computational methods and techniques applied for solving these have been designed case-by-case. Results concern, among others, appropriate parametrization of inverse problems; two-stage reconstruction processes, in which a region of interest (ROI) is determined in the first stage and the actual reconstruction is found in the second stage; effective forward simulation through hand pversions of the finite element method (FEM); localization of dipole-like electric sources through hierarchical Bayesian models; implementation of the Kirsch factorization method for reconstruction of conductivity anomalies; as well as the use of a coarse-to-fine reconstruction strategy in linear inverse problems.

In this work, we address the following question:\textbackslash textitGiven a set of measurements obtained from real imaging experiments, what is the best way to use a learnable model and the physics of the modality to solve the inverse problem and reconstruct the latent image?  Standard supervised learning based methods approach this problem by collecting data sets of known latent images and their corresponding measurements. However, these methods are often impractical due to the lack of availability of appropriately sized training sets, and, more generally, due to the inherent difficulty in measuring the "groundtruth" latent image. In light of this, we propose a self-supervised approach to training inverse models in medical imaging in the absence of aligned data. Our method only requiring access to the measurements and the forward model at training. We showcase its effectiveness on inverse problems arising in accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).}

  abstract = {Reconstructing medical images from partial measurements is an important inverse problem in Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Existing solutions based on machine learning typically train a model to directly map measurements to medical images, leveraging a training dataset of paired images and measurements. These measurements are typically synthesized from images using a fixed physical model of the measurement process, which hinders the generalization capability of models to unknown measurement processes. To address this issue, we propose a fully unsupervised technique for inverse problem solving, leveraging the recently introduced score-based generative models. Specifically, we first train a score-based generative model on medical images to capture their prior distribution. Given measurements and a physical model of the measurement process at test time, we introduce a sampling method to reconstruct an image consistent with both the prior and the observed measurements. Our method does not assume a fixed measurement process during training, and can thus be flexibly adapted to different measurement processes at test time. Empirically, we observe comparable or better performance to supervised learning techniques in several medical imaging tasks in CT and MRI, while demonstrating significantly better generalization to unknown measurement processes.},

Here, we present a dynamic approach based on multiobjective genetic algorithm for the training of ReaxFF parameters and uncertainty quantification of simulated quantities of interest.

  abstract = {To make practical the molecular dynamics simulation of large scale reactive chemical systems (1000s of atoms), we developed ReaxFF, a force field for reactive systems. ReaxFF uses a general relationship between bond distance and bond order on one hand and between bond order and bond energy on the other hand that leads to proper dissociation of bonds to separated atoms. Other valence terms present in the force field (angle and torsion) are defined in terms of the same bond orders so that all these terms go to zero smoothly as bonds break. In addition, ReaxFF has Coulomb and Morse (van der Waals) potentials to describe nonbond interactions between all atoms (no exclusions). These nonbond interactions are shielded at short range so that the Coulomb and van der Waals interactions become constant as Rij → 0. We report here the ReaxFF for hydrocarbons. The parameters were derived from quantum chemical calculations on bond dissociation and reactions of small molecules plus heat of formation and geometry data for a number of stable hydrocarbon compounds. We find that the ReaxFF provides a good description of these data. Generally, the results are of an accuracy similar or better than PM3, while ReaxFF is about 100 times faster. In turn, the PM3 is about 100 times faster than the QC calculations. Thus, with ReaxFF we hope to be able to study complex reactions in hydrocarbons.},

    abstract = { The first step in the construction of a regression model or a data-driven analysis, aiming to predict or elucidate the relationship between the atomic-scale structure of matter and its properties, involves transforming the Cartesian coordinates of the atoms into a suitable representation. The development of atomic-scale representations has played, and continues to play, a central role in the success of machine-learning methods for chemistry and materials science. This review summarizes the current understanding of the nature and characteristics of the most commonly used structural and chemical descriptions of atomistic structures, highlighting the deep underlying connections between different frameworks and the ideas that lead to computationally efficient and universally applicable models. It emphasizes the link between properties, structures, their physical chemistry, and their mathematical description, provides examples of recent applications to a diverse set of chemical and materials science problems, and outlines the open questions and the most promising research directions in the field. }

We show evidence, from an examination of the distribution of pairwise distances between frames, that some features of the free-energy surface are inherently high-dimensional. This makes dimensionality reduction problematic because the data does not satisfy the assumptions made in conventional manifold learning algorithms We therefore propose that when dimensionality reduction is performed on trajectory data one should think of the resultant embedding as a quickly sketched set of directions rather than a road map. In other words, the embedding tells one about the connectivity between states but does not provide the vectors that correspond to the slow degrees of freedom. This realization informs the development of sketch-map, which endeavors to reproduce the proximity information from the high-dimensionality description in a space of lower dimensionality even when a faithful embedding is not possible.}}

The core of new material prediction is to find the relationship between material structure and properties. In this research, machine learning will have important advantages and play an important role for materials data. In this paper,we put forward a framework combining feature engineering and linear regression to find the correlation between structure and properties from materials data. High temperature superconductor and double perovskites for solar cells were employed to test the feasibility of the method. In the former, we successfully rebuilt a descriptor (l\zeta{})\textminus{}1 from data mining which is consistent with the theoretical formula. In the latter, as an exploration, we obtain a new descriptor \chi{} b 2 rs x 2 e rs x \textminus{} 1 from data mining which expresses the heat of formation (\Delta{}HF) in the double perovskite. By our experiment, the method can obtain related expressions of structure-property relationship for material.The results show that the method is a simple yet efficient paradigm to construct the structure-property relationship and provides valuable hints to accelerate the process of materials design.},

Most of this work relies on defining clever feature representations, in which the chemical graph structure is encoded in a uniform way such that predictions across chemical space can be made. In this work, we propose to exploit the powerful ability of deep neural networks to learn a feature representation from low-level encodings of a huge corpus of chemical structures. Our model borrows ideas from neural machine translation: it translates between two semantically equivalent but syntactically different representations of molecular structures, compressing the meaningful information both representations have in common in a low-dimensional representation vector. Once the model is trained, this representation can be extracted for any new molecule and utilized as descriptor. In fair benchmarks with respect to various human-engineered molecular fingerprints and graph-convolution models, our method shows competitive performance in modelling quantitative structure-activity relationships in all analyzed datasets. Additionally, we show that our descriptor significantly outperforms all baseline molecular fingerprints in two ligand-based virtual screening tasks. Overall, our descriptors show the most consistent performances over all experiments. The continuity of the descriptor space and the existence of the decoder that permits to deduce a chemical structure from an embedding vector allows for exploration of the space and opens up new opportunities for compound optimization and idea generation.},

Molecular descriptors and fingerprints have been routinely used in QSAR/SAR analysis, virtual drug screening, compound search/ranking, drug ADME/T prediction and other drug discovery processes. Since the calculation of such quantitative representations of molecules may require substantial computational skills and efforts, several tools have been previously developed to make an attempt to ease the process. However, there are still several hurdles for users to overcome to fully harness the power of these tools. First, most of the tools are distributed as standalone software or packages that require necessary configuration or programming efforts of users. Second, many of the tools can only calculate a subset of molecular descriptors, and the results from multiple tools need to be manually merged to generate a comprehensive set of descriptors. Third, some packages only provide application programming interfaces and are implemented in different computer languages, which pose additional challenges to the integration of these tools.Results

A freely available web-based platform, named ChemDes, is developed in this study. It integrates multiple state-of-the-art packages (i.e., Pybel, CDK, RDKit, BlueDesc, Chemopy, PaDEL and jCompoundMapper) for computing molecular descriptors and fingerprints. ChemDes not only provides friendly web interfaces to relieve users from burdensome programming work, but also offers three useful and convenient auxiliary tools for format converting, MOPAC optimization and fingerprint similarity calculation. Currently, ChemDes has the capability of computing 3679 molecular descriptors and 59 types of molecular fingerprints.ConclusionChemDes provides users an integrated and friendly tool to calculate various molecular descriptors and fingerprints. It is freely available at http://www.scbdd.com/chemdes. The source code of the project is also available as a supplementary file.},

We describe a new type of descriptor of this type, the charge fingerprint. This descriptor family can build good QSAR models of a diverse range of physicochemical and biological properties and can be calculated quickly and easily. It appears to be useful for modeling large data sets and has potential for screening large virtual libraries.},

The ‘atomic body-ordered permutation-invariant polynomials’ comprise a systematic basis and are constructed to preserve the symmetry of the potential energy function with respect to rotations and permutations. In contrast to kernel based and artificial neural network models, the explicit decomposition of the total energy as a sum of atomic body-ordered terms allows to keep the dimensionality of the fit reasonably low, up to just 10 for the 5-body terms. The explainability of the potential is aided by this decomposition, as the low body-order components can be studied and interpreted independently. Moreover, although polynomial basis functions are thought to extrapolate poorly, we show that the low dimensionality combined with careful regularisation actually leads to better transferability than the high dimensional, kernel based Gaussian Approximation Potential.}

              Background
              There are two line notations of chemical structures that have established themselves in the field: the SMILES string and the InChI string. The InChI aims to provide a unique, or canonical, identifier for chemical structures, while SMILES strings are widely used for storage and interchange of chemical structures, but no standard exists to generate a canonical SMILES string.
            
            
              Results
              I describe how to use the InChI canonicalisation to derive a canonical SMILES string in a straightforward way, either incorporating the InChI normalisations (Inchified SMILES) or not (Universal SMILES). This is the first description of a method to generate canonical SMILES that takes stereochemistry into account. When tested on the 1.1 m compounds in the ChEMBL database, and a 1 m compound subset of the PubChem Substance database, no canonicalisation failures were found with Inchified SMILES. Using Universal SMILES, 99.79\% of the ChEMBL database was canonicalised successfully and 99.77\% of the PubChem subset.
            
            
              Conclusions
              The InChI canonicalisation algorithm can successfully be used as the basis for a common standard for canonical SMILES. While challenges remain – such as the development of a standard aromatic model for SMILES – the ability to create the same SMILES using different toolkits will mean that for the first time it will be possible to easily compare the chemical models used by different toolkits.},

However, their rational design is not well established, and currently less than 6,000 experimentally synthesized 2D materials have been reported. Recently, deep learning, data-mining, and density functional theory (DFT)-based high-throughput calculations are widely performed to discover potential new materials for diverse applications. Here we propose a generative material design pipeline, namely material transformer generator(MTG), for large-scale discovery of hypothetical 2D materials. We train two 2D materials composition generators using self-learning neural language models based on Transformers with and without transfer learning. The models are then used to generate a large number of candidate 2D compositions, which are fed to known 2D materials templates for crystal structure prediction. Next, we performed DFT computations to study their thermodynamic stability based on energy-above-hull and formation energy. We report four new DFT-verified stable 2D materials with zero e-above-hull energies, including NiCl\$\_4\$, IrSBr, CuBr\$\_3\$, and CoBrCl. Our work thus demonstrates the potential of our MTG generative materials design pipeline in the discovery of novel 2D materials and other functional materials.},

  abstract = {Hydrogen economy, wherein hydrogen is used as the fuel in the transport and energy sectors, holds significant promise in mitigating the deleterious effects of global warming. Photocatalytic water splitting using sunlight is perhaps the cleanest way of producing the hydrogen fuel. Among various other factors, widespread adoption of this technology has mainly been stymied by the lack of a catalyst material with high efficiency. 2D materials have shown significant promise as efficient photocatalysts for water splitting. The availability of open databases containing the “computed” properties of 2D materials and advancements in deep learning now enable us to do “inverse” design of these 2D photocatalysts for water splitting. We use one such database (Jain et al., ACS Energ. Lett. 2019, 4, 6, 1410–1411) to build a generative model for the discovery of novel 2D photocatalysts. The structures of the materials were converted into a 3D image–based representation that was used to train a cell, a basis autoencoder and a segmentation network to ascertain the lattice parameters as well as position of atoms from the images. Subsequently, the cell and basis encodings were used to train a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) to learn a continuous representation of the materials in a latent space. The latent space of the CVAE was then sampled to generate several new 2D materials that were likely to be efficient photocatalysts for water splitting. The bandgap of the generated materials was predicted using a graph neural network model while the band edge positions were obtained via empirical correlations. Although our generative modeling framework was used to discover novel 2D photocatalysts for water splitting reaction, it is generic in nature and can be used directly to discover novel materials for other applications as well.},

In this paper, we introduce the Materials Project (www.materialsproject.org), a core program of the Materials Genome Initiative that uses high-throughput computing to uncover the properties of all known inorganic materials. This open dataset can be accessed through multiple channels for both interactive exploration and data mining. The Materials Project also seeks to create open-source platforms for developing robust, sophisticated materials analyses. Future efforts will enable users to perform ‘‘rapid-prototyping’’ of new materials in silico, and provide researchers with new avenues for cost-effective, data-driven materials design.},

While these simulations provide high-fidelity models, they are poorly suited for inference and lead to challenging inverse problems.

Finally, we describe how the frontier is expanding so that a broad audience can appreciate the profound influence these developments may have on science.},

  abstract = {Batch Normalization is a key component in almost all state-of-the-art image classifiers, but it also introduces practical challenges: it breaks the independence between training examples within a batch, can incur compute and memory overhead, and often results in unexpected bugs. Building on recent theoretical analyses of deep ResNets at initialization, we propose a simple set of analysis tools to characterize signal propagation on the forward pass, and leverage these tools to design highly performant ResNets without activation normalization layers. Crucial to our success is an adapted version of the recently proposed Weight Standardization. Our analysis tools show how this technique preserves the signal in networks with ReLU or Swish activation functions by ensuring that the per-channel activation means do not grow with depth. Across a range of FLOP budgets, our networks attain performance competitive with the state-of-the-art EfficientNets on ImageNet.},

  abstract = {By decomposing the image formation process into a sequential application of denoising autoencoders, diffusion models (DMs) achieve state-of-the-art synthesis results on image data and beyond. Additionally, their formulation allows for a guiding mechanism to control the image generation process without retraining. However, since these models typically operate directly in pixel space, optimization of powerful DMs often consumes hundreds of GPU days and inference is expensive due to sequential evaluations. To enable DM training on limited computational resources while retaining their quality and flexibility, we apply them in the latent space of powerful pretrained autoencoders. In contrast to previous work, training diffusion models on such a representation allows for the first time to reach a near-optimal point between complexity reduction and detail preservation, greatly boosting visual fidelity. By introducing cross-attention layers into the model architecture, we turn diffusion models into powerful and flexible generators for general conditioning inputs such as text or bounding boxes and high-resolution synthesis becomes possible in a convolutional manner. Our latent diffusion models (LDMs) achieve a new state of the art for image inpainting and highly competitive performance on various tasks, including unconditional image generation, semantic scene synthesis, and super-resolution, while significantly reducing computational requirements compared to pixel-based DMs. Code is available at https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion .},

  abstract = {Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.},

  abstract = {The game of Go has long been viewed as the most challenging of classic games for artificial intelligence owing to its enormous search space and the difficulty of evaluating board positions and moves. Here we introduce a new approach to computer Go that uses ‘value networks’ to evaluate board positions and ‘policy networks’ to select moves. These deep neural networks are trained by a novel combination of supervised learning from human expert games, and reinforcement learning from games of self-play. Without any lookahead search, the neural networks play Go at the level of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tree search programs that simulate thousands of random games of self-play. We also introduce a new search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks. Using this search algorithm, our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8\% winning rate against other Go programs, and defeated the human European Go champion by 5 games to 0. This is the first time that a computer program has defeated a human professional player in the full-sized game of Go, a feat previously thought to be at least a decade away.},

  abstract = {Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1–4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’8—has been an important open research problem for more than 50~years9. Despite recent progress10–14, existing methods fall far~short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

  abstract = {Graph neural networks have recently achieved great successes in predicting quantum mechanical properties of molecules. These models represent a molecule as a graph using only the distance between atoms (nodes). They do not, however, consider the spatial direction from one atom to another, despite directional information playing a central role in empirical potentials for molecules, e.g. in angular potentials. To alleviate this limitation we propose directional message passing, in which we embed the messages passed between atoms instead of the atoms themselves. Each message is associated with a direction in coordinate space. These directional message embeddings are rotationally equivariant since the associated directions rotate with the molecule. We propose a message passing scheme analogous to belief propagation, which uses the directional information by transforming messages based on the angle between them. Additionally, we use spherical Bessel functions and spherical harmonics to construct theoretically well-founded, orthogonal representations that achieve better performance than the currently prevalent Gaussian radial basis representations while using fewer than 1/4 of the parameters. We leverage these innovations to construct the directional message passing neural network (DimeNet). DimeNet outperforms previous GNNs on average by 76\% on MD17 and by 31\% on QM9. Our implementation is available online.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has undergone a renaissance recently, making major progress in key domains such as vision, language, control, and decision-making. This has been due, in part, to cheap data and cheap compute resources, which have fit the natural strengths of deep learning. However, many defining characteristics of human intelligence, which developed under much different pressures, remain out of reach for current approaches. In particular, generalizing beyond one's experiences--a hallmark of human intelligence from infancy--remains a formidable challenge for modern AI. The following is part position paper, part review, and part unification. We argue that combinatorial generalization must be a top priority for AI to achieve human-like abilities, and that structured representations and computations are key to realizing this objective. Just as biology uses nature and nurture cooperatively, we reject the false choice between "hand-engineering" and "end-to-end" learning, and instead advocate for an approach which benefits from their complementary strengths. We explore how using relational inductive biases within deep learning architectures can facilitate learning about entities, relations, and rules for composing them. We present a new building block for the AI toolkit with a strong relational inductive bias--the graph network--which generalizes and extends various approaches for neural networks that operate on graphs, and provides a straightforward interface for manipulating structured knowledge and producing structured behaviors. We discuss how graph networks can support relational reasoning and combinatorial generalization, laying the foundation for more sophisticated, interpretable, and flexible patterns of reasoning. As a companion to this paper, we have released an open-source software library for building graph networks, with demonstrations of how to use them in practice.},

  abstract = {Supervised learning on molecules has incredible potential to be useful in chemistry, drug discovery, and materials science. Luckily, several promising and closely related neural network models invariant to molecular symmetries have already been described in the literature. These models learn a message passing algorithm and aggregation procedure to compute a function of their entire input graph. At this point, the next step is to find a particularly effective variant of this general approach and apply it to chemical prediction benchmarks until we either solve them or reach the limits of the approach. In this paper, we reformulate existing models into a single common framework we call Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) and explore additional novel variations within this framework. Using MPNNs we demonstrate state of the art results on an important molecular property prediction benchmark; these results are strong enough that we believe future work should focus on datasets with larger molecules or more accurate ground truth labels.},

abstract = {This chapter addresses the role that data-driven approaches, especially machine learning methods, are expected to play in materials research in the immediate future. Machine learning, an important part of artificial intelligence, has made monumental contributions to areas outside materials science, ranging from commerce to gaming to search engines to drug design. Machine learning algorithms can be separated into two broad classes: supervised and unsupervised learning. The chapter first provides the necessary mathematical background to allow a materials researcher entering this field to use these methods most effectively. It then presents an assortment of examples of recent machine learning applications within materials science. The chapter also discusses a range of emerging efforts, including high-throughput phase diagram and crystal structure determination methods, accelerated prediction of materials properties, development of interatomic potentials and functionals for accelerating materials simulations, and efficient and low-cost methods for materials process control},

  abstract = {Inverse optimal control (IOC) is a powerful theory that addresses the inverse problems in control systems, robotics, Machine Learning (ML) and optimization taking into account the optimal manners. This paper reviews the history of the IOC and Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) approaches and describes the connections and differences between them to cover the research gap in the existing literature. The general formulation of IOC/IRL is described and the related methods are categorized based on a hierarchical approach. For this purpose, IOC methods are categorized under two classes, namely classic and modern approaches. The classic IOC is typically formulated for control systems, while IRL, as a modern approach to IOC, is considered for machine learning problems. Despite the presence of a handful of IOC/IRL methods, a comprehensive categorization of these methods is lacking. In addition to the IOC/IRL problems, this paper elaborates, where necessary, on other relevant concepts such as Learning from Demonstration (LfD), Imitation Learning (IL), and Behavioral Cloning.

To do this we employ acoustic, electromagnetic, and elastic waves for presenting different types of inverse problems. More specifically, we first study location, shape, and boundary parameter reconstruction algorithms for the inaccessible targets in acoustics. The inverse problems for the time-dependent differential equations of isotropic and anisotropic elasticity are reviewed in the following section of the paper. These problems were the objects of the study by many authors in the last several decades. The physical interpretations for almost all of these problems are given, and the geophysical applications for some of them are described. In our last section, an introduction with many links into the literature is given for modern algorithms which combine techniques from classical inverse problems with stochastic tools into ensemble methods both for data assimilation as well as for forecasting.},

A central stepping stone toward realizing this promise is the demonstration of multifunctionality under several constraints (e.g., at multiple incident wavelengths and/or angles) in a single device, an achievement being hampered by design limitations inherent to single-layer planar geometries. Here, we propose a framework for the inverse design of multilayer metaoptics via topology optimization, showing that even few-wavelength thick devices can achieve high-efficiency multifunctionality, such as multiangle light concentration and plan-achromaticity. We embody our framework in multiple closely spaced patterned layers of a low-index polymer, with fabrication constraints specific to this platform enforced in the optimization process. We experimentally demonstrate our approach with an inverse-designed 3D-printed light concentrator working at five different nonparaxial angles of incidence. Our framework paves the way toward realizing multifunctional ultracompact 3D nanophotonic devices.},

The method was originally developed for mechanical design problems but has within the last six years been applied to a range of photonics applications. Topology optimization may be based on finite element and finite difference type modeling methods in both frequency and time domain. The basic idea is that the material density of each element or grid point is a design variable, hence the geometry is parameterized in a pixel-like fashion. The optimization problem is efficiently solved using mathematical programming-based optimization methods and analytical gradient calculations.

Since the training is performed on digital hardware, in this paper, we analyze what actually can be computed on current hardware platforms modeled as Turing machines, which would lead to inherent restrictions of deep learning. For this, we focus on the class of inverse problems, which, in particular, encompasses any task to reconstruct data from measurements. We prove that finite-dimensional inverse problems are not Banach-Mazur computable for small relaxation parameters. In fact, our result even holds for Borel-Turing computability., i.e., there does not exist an algorithm which performs the training of a neural network on digital hardware for any given accuracy. Even more, our results introduce a lower bound on the accuracy that can be obtained algorithmically. This establishes a conceptual barrier on the capabilities of neural networks for finite-dimensional inverse problems given that the computations are performed on digital hardware.},

However, the present-day staggering variety of colloidal building blocks and the limitless number of thermodynamic conditions make a systematic exploration intractable. The true challenge in this field is to turn this logic around, and to develop a robust, versatile algorithm to inverse design colloids that self-assemble into a target structure. Here, we introduce a generic inverse design method to efficiently reverse-engineer crystals, quasicrystals, and liquid crystals by targeting their diffraction patterns. Our algorithm relies on the synergetic use of an evolutionary strategy for parameter optimization, and a convolutional neural network as an order parameter, and provides a new way forward for the inverse design of experimentally feasible colloidal interactions, specifically optimized to stabilize the desired structure.},

These ideas have contributed in large measure to advancing, accelerating, and expanding the scope of discovery. Recent advances in data analytics can potentially transform the discipline of chemistry and its practice. However, taking advantage of the “Big Data” paradigm requires a distinctive set of skills that are not thus far in the usual repertoire of chemistry or materials science graduate students who typically receive little formal training in handling large data sets. In this Chapter, we outline a recently initiated interdisciplinary graduate program focused on “Data-Enabled Discovery and Design of Energy Materials (D3EM)” that seeks to explore a novel model for interdisciplinary graduate education with a materials chemistry and materials science core at Texas A\&M University. D3EM’s overarching goal is to develop and institutionalize a new training model that produces scientists/engineers grounded in one discipline but who have the professional and technical skills to collaborate and lead interdisciplinary teams, throughout their academic careers and beyond. The contribution seeks to outline our motivations for designing an interdisciplinary program, describes the structure of the program, and provides specific case studies of research projects that have benefited from an interdisciplinary perspective. Some salient aspects of the program include: 1) learning outcomes aligned with critical skills identified by potential employers; 2) a comprehensive e-portfolio to enable students to internalize interdisciplinarity; 3) a capstone Materials Discovery and Design Studio to promote interdisciplinary approaches to the solution of complex materials development problems; 4) the creation of a faculty community of scholars to facilitate the internalization of interdisciplinarity within faculty participants; and 5) a first-year graduate training sequence featuring strong disciplinary grounding followed by an interdisciplinary immersion––to ensure that the student have a sufficient disciplinary foundation.},

Given their coefficients, wave equations can be solved to high accuracy, but the presence of the wavelength scale often leads to large computer simulations for anything beyond the simplest geometries. The inverse problem, determining the coefficients from a field on a boundary, is even more demanding, since traditional optimization requires a large number of forward problems be solved sequentially. Here we show that the free-form inverse problem of wave equations can be solved with machine learning. First we show that deep neural networks can be used to predict the optical properties of nanostructured materials such as metasurfaces. Then we demonstrate the free-form inverse design of such nanostructures and show that constraints imposed by experimental feasibility can be taken into account. Our neural networks promise automated design in several technologies based on the wave equation.},

This framework solves the forward elasticity problem by the deep energy method (DEM). Instead of training a separate neural network to update the density distribution, we leverage the fact that the compliance minimization problem is self-adjoint to express the element sensitivity directly in terms of the displacement field from the DEM model, and thus no additional neural network is needed for the inverse problem. The method of moving asymptotes is used as the optimizer for updating density distribution. The implementation of Neumann, Dirichlet, and periodic boundary conditions are described in the context of the DEM model. Three numerical examples are presented to demonstrate framework capabilities: (1) Compliance minimization in 2D under different geometries and loading, (2) Compliance minimization in 3D, and (3) Maximization of homogenized shear modulus to design 2D meta material unit cells. The results show that the optimized designs from the DEM-based framework are very comparable to those generated by the finite element method, and shed light on a new way of integrating PINN-based simulation methods into classical computational mechanics problems.},

  abstract = {The braking performance of the brake system is a target performance that must be considered for vehicle development. Apparent piston travel (APT) and drag torque are the most representative factors for evaluating braking performance. In particular, as the two performance factors have a conflicting relationship with each other, a multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) approach is required for brake design. However, the computational cost of MDO increases as the number of disciplines increases. Recent studies on inverse design that use deep learning (DL) have established the possibility of instantly generating an optimal design that can satisfy the target performance without implementing an iterative optimization process. This study proposes a DL-based multidisciplinary inverse design (MID) that simultaneously satisfies multiple targets, such as the APT and drag torque of the brake system. Results show that the proposed inverse design can find the optimal design more efficiently compared with the conventional optimization methods, such as backpropagation and sequential quadratic programming. The MID achieved a similar performance to the single-disciplinary inverse design in terms of accuracy and computational cost. A novel design was derived on the basis of results, and the same performance was satisfied as that of the existing design.},

  abstract = {Recovering a function or high-dimensional parameter vector from indirect measurements is a central task in various scientific areas. Several methods for solving such inverse problems are well developed and well understood. Recently, novel algorithms using deep learning and neural networks for inverse problems appeared. While still in their infancy, these techniques show astonishing performance for applications like low-dose CT or various sparse data problems. However, there are few theoretical results for deep learning in inverse problems. In this paper, we establish a complete convergence analysis for the proposed NETT (network Tikhonov) approach to inverse problems. NETT considers nearly data-consistent solutions having small value of a regularizer defined by a trained neural network. We derive well-posedness results and quantitative error estimates, and propose a possible strategy for training the regularizer. Our theoretical results and framework are different from any previous work using neural networks for solving inverse problems. A possible data driven regularizer is proposed. Numerical results are presented for a tomographic sparse data problem, which demonstrate good performance of NETT even for unknowns of different type from the training data. To derive the convergence and convergence rates results we introduce a new framework based on the absolute Bregman distance generalizing the standard Bregman distance from the convex to the non-convex case.},

  abstract = {The advent of two-dimensional metamaterials in recent years has ushered in a revolutionary means to manipulate the behavior of light on the nanoscale. The effective parameters of these architected materials render unprecedented control over the optical properties of light, thereby eliciting previously unattainable applications in flat lenses, holographic imaging, and emission control among others. The design of such structures, to date, has relied on the expertise of an optical scientist to guide a progression of electromagnetic simulations that iteratively solve Maxwell’s equations until a locally optimized solution can be attained. In this work, we identify a solution to circumvent this intuition-guided design by means of a deep learning architecture. When fed an input set of optical spectra, the constructed generative network assimilates a candidate pattern from a user-defined dataset of geometric structures in order to match the input spectra. The generated metamaterial patterns demonstrate high fidelity, yielding equivalent optical spectra at an average accuracy of about 0.9. This approach reveals an opportunity to expedite the discovery and design of metasurfaces for tailored optical responses in a systematic, inverse-design manner.},

  abstract = {The research of metamaterials has achieved enormous success in the manipulation of light in an artificially prescribed manner using delicately designed sub-wavelength structures, so-called meta-atoms. Even though modern numerical methods allow to accurately calculate the optical response of complex structures, the inverse design of metamaterials is still a challenging task due to the non-intuitive and non-unique relationship between physical structures and optical responses. To better unveil this implicit relationship and thus facilitate metamaterial design, we propose to represent metamaterials and model the inverse design problem in a probabilistically generative manner. By employing an encoder-decoder configuration, our deep generative model compresses the meta-atom design and optical response into a latent space, where similar designs and similar optical responses are automatically clustered together. Therefore, by sampling in the latent space, the stochastic latent variables function as codes, from which the candidate designs are generated upon given requirements in a decoding process. With the effective latent representation of metamaterials, we can elegantly model the complex structure-performance relationship in an interpretable way, and solve the one-to-many mapping issue that is intractable in a deterministic model. Moreover, to alleviate the burden of numerical calculation in data collection, we develop a semi-supervised learning strategy that allows our model to utilize unlabeled data in addition to labeled data during training, simultaneously optimizing the generative inverse design and deterministic forward prediction in an end-to-end manner. On a data-driven basis, the proposed model can serve as a comprehensive and efficient tool that accelerates the design, characterization and even new discovery in the research domain of metamaterials and photonics in general.},

  abstract = {History matching refers to calibration of geologic models so that they can reproduce historical production data. Automatic history matching is performed by solving inverse problems, in which production data mismatch is minimized by iteratively updating reservoir parameters in the direction of decreasing loss function. Conventional algorithms involve many reservoir simulation runs that must be performed online (during history matching), which make the process time-consuming. We have developed a novel machine learning-based approach to history matching where the goal is to learn the mapping from model input and response data during the training phase and use the trained model to generate calibrated reservoir models for a given production data. The advantage of this approach is that the time-consuming training step is performed off-line, enabling a more real-time history matching workflow with the trained model. A challenging aspect in history matching is that historical production data support only coarse-scale geologic features. Hence, without proper parameterization and regularization, the resulting inverse problems are ill-posed. Similarly, the computational efficiency is significantly improved by learning the mapping between low-dimensional representations of geologic realizations and the associated simulated production data. We demonstrate the new approach using a 2D Gaussian field and a complex 3D channelized reservoir. © 81st EAGE Conference and Exhibition 2019. All rights reserved.},

We use the prediction of SS prototypes for spintronic applications as an illustrative example of the proposed workflow. The prediction process starts with the establishment of the design principles (the physical mechanism behind the target properties), that are used as filters for materials screening, and followed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Applying this process to the C2DB database, we identify and classify 358 2D materials according to SS type at the valence and/or conduction bands. The Bayesian optimization captures trends that are used for the rationalized design of 2D materials with the ideal conditions of band gap and SS for potential spintronics applications. Our workflow can be applied to any other material property.},

The explosive growth in scientific literature and data has made it ever harder to discover useful insights in a large mass of information. Today scientific knowledge is accessed through search engines, but they are unable to organize scientific knowledge alone. In this paper we introduce Galactica: a large language model that can store, combine and reason about scientific knowledge. We train on a large scientific corpus of papers, reference material, knowledge bases and many other sources. We outperform existing models on a range of scientific tasks. On technical knowledge probes such as LaTeX equations, Galactica outperforms the latest GPT-3 by 68.2\% versus 49.0\%. Galactica also performs well on reasoning, outperforming Chinchilla on mathematical MMLU by 41.3\% to 35.7\%, and PaLM 540B on MATH with a score of 20.4\% versus 8.8\%. It also sets a new state-of-the-art on downstream tasks such as PubMedQA and MedMCQA dev of 77.6\% and 52.9\%. And despite not being trained on a general corpus, Galactica outperforms BLOOM and OPT-175B on BIG-bench. We believe these results demonstrate the potential for language models as a new interface for science. We open source the model for the benefit of the scientific community.},

At present, the demand for the development of materials and the invention or design of new materials is becoming more and more urgent since peoples’ current production and lifestyle needs must be changed to help mitigate the climate. Structure-property relationships are a vital paradigm in materials science. However, these relationships are often nonlinear, and the pattern is likely to change with length scales and time scales, posing a huge challenge. With the development of physics, statistics, computer science, etc., machine learning offers the opportunity to systematically find new materials. Especially by inverse design based on machine learning, one can make use of the existing knowledge without attempting mathematical inversion of the relevant integrated differential equation of the electronic structure but by using backpropagation to overcome local minimax traps and perform a fast calculation of the gradient information for a target function concerning the design variable to find the optimizations. The methodologies have been applied to various materials including polymers, photonics, inorganic materials, porous materials, 2-D materials, etc. Different types of design problems require different approaches, for which many algorithms and optimization approaches have been demonstrated in different scenarios. In this mini-review, we will not specifically sum up machine learning methodologies, but will provide a more material perspective and summarize some cut-edging studies.},

  abstract = {Generating the periodic structure of stable materials is a long-standing challenge for the material design community. This task is difficult because stable materials only exist in a low-dimensional subspace of all possible periodic arrangements of atoms: 1) the coordinates must lie in the local energy minimum defined by quantum mechanics, and 2) global stability also requires the structure to follow the complex, yet specific bonding preferences between different atom types. Existing methods fail to incorporate these factors and often lack proper invariances. We propose a Crystal Diffusion Variational Autoencoder (CDVAE) that captures the physical inductive bias of material stability. By learning from the data distribution of stable materials, the decoder generates materials in a diffusion process that moves atomic coordinates towards a lower energy state and updates atom types to satisfy bonding preferences between neighbors. Our model also explicitly encodes interactions across periodic boundaries and respects permutation, translation, rotation, and periodic invariances. We significantly outperform past methods in three tasks: 1) reconstructing the input structure, 2) generating valid, diverse, and realistic materials, and 3) generating materials that optimize a specific property. We also provide several standard datasets and evaluation metrics for the broader machine learning community.},

However, the number of known materials deposited in the popular materials databases such as ICSD and Materials Project is extremely limited and consists of just a tiny portion of the vast chemical design space. Herein we present an active generative inverse design method that combines active learning with a deep variational autoencoder neural network and a generative adversarial deep neural network model to discover new materials with a target property in the whole chemical design space. The application of this method has allowed us to discover new thermodynamically stable materials with high band gap (SrYF\$\_5\$) and semiconductors with specified band gap ranges (SrClF\$\_3\$, CaClF\$\_5\$, YCl\$\_3\$, SrC\$\_2\$F\$\_3\$, AlSCl, As\$\_2\$O\$\_3\$), all of which are verified by the first principle DFT calculations. Our experiments show that while active learning itself may sample chemically infeasible candidates, these samples help to train effective screening models for filtering out materials with desired properties from the hypothetical materials created by the generative model. The experiments show the effectiveness of our active generative inverse design approach.},

  abstract = {In recent years, hybrid design strategies combining machine learning (ML) with electromagnetic optimization algorithms have emerged as a new paradigm for the inverse design of photonic structures and devices. While a trained, data-driven neural network can rapidly identify solutions near the global optimum with a given data set’s design space, an iterative optimization algorithm can further refine the solution and overcome data set limitations. Furthermore, such hybrid ML-optimization methodologies can reduce computational costs and expedite the discovery of novel electromagnetic components. However, existing hybrid ML-optimization methods have yet to optimize across both materials and geometries in a single integrated and user-friendly environment. In addition, due to the challenge of acquiring large data sets for ML, as well as the exponential growth of isolated models being trained for photonics design, there is a need to standardize the ML-optimization workflow while making the pretrained models easily accessible. Motivated by these challenges, here we introduce DeepAdjoint, a general-purpose, open-source, and multiobjective “all-in-one” global photonics inverse design application framework that integrates pretrained deep generative networks with state-of-the-art electromagnetic optimization algorithms such as the adjoint variables method. DeepAdjoint allows a designer to specify an arbitrary optical design target, then obtain a photonic structure that is robust to fabrication tolerances and possesses the desired optical properties, all within a single user-guided application interface. We demonstrate DeepAdjoint for the design of infrared-controlled metasurfaces and show that a wide range of structures and absorption spectra can be achieved and optimized, including single- and multiresonance behavior through single- and supercell-class structures, respectively. Our framework, thus, paves a path toward the systematic unification of ML and optimization algorithms for photonic inverse design.},

In general, the laws of physics provide the means for computing the data values given a model. This is called the “forward problem”, see figure 1. In the inverse problem, the aim is to reconstruct the model from a set of measurements. In the ideal case, an exact theory exists that prescribes how the data should be transformed in order to reproduce the model. For some selected examples such a theory exists assuming that the required infinite and noise-free data sets would be available. A quantum mechanical potential in one spatial dimension can be reconstructed when the reflection coefficient is known for all energies [Marchenko, 1955; Burridge, 1980]. This technique can be generalized for the reconstruction of a quantum mechanical potential in three dimensions [Newton, 1989], but in that case a redundant data set is required for reasons that are not well understood. The mass-density in a one-dimensional string can be constructed from the measurements of all eigenfrequencies of that string [Borg, 1946], but due to the symmetry of this problem only the even part of the mass-density can be determined. If the seismic velocity in the earth depends only on depth, the velocity can be constructed exactly from the measurement of the arrival time as a function of distance of seismic waves using an Abel transform [Herglotz, 1907], [Wiechert, 1907].},

  abstract = {Abstract Discovering modeling errors on large finite element models is complex and can often go unnoticed, particularly once good “correlation” is achieved. The signs of trouble and/or inaccuracies need to be recognized and, at the very least, the effects of system simplifications on a model's accuracy need to be known. One danger in using simplified models occurs when the models, which have been correlated to test results, are used for predictive work. When predictive work begins, it is extremely difficult to determine if model “simplifications” have a small or large influence on the predictions. Fortunately, there are things that can be done to help recognize potential trouble. Similar to the examples shown in this paper, a library of small test models should be created in order to evaluate modeling techniques and code features. The evaluation should include determining limitations of the techniques and features that may cause modeling errors when applied to larger systems. This is analogous to the design process itself, where components must first be designed and thoroughly tested and understood before they can be reliably used in larger systems.}

  abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter focuses on ill-posed problems in partial differential equations. Typically, solutions of ill-posed problems, unless they are appropriately constrained, will not depend continuously on any quantities that are subject to error in the modeling of the problem, and it is never clear a priori that a constraint that will bring about continuous dependence under one type of perturbation will also guarantee continuous dependence under another. For instance, a constraint set restriction that implies continuous dependence on the Cauchy data will not necessarily insure continuous dependence on coefficients. Two major sources of error have been largely ignored in the literature: (1) errors in geometry and (2) errors in modeling. The latter errors are in general more difficult to deal with than the more commonly treated errors in Cauchy data. In fact, it is the inability to adequately regularize against such errors that casts doubt on the entire study of ill-posed problems in partial differential equations as an accurate predictor of what will occur in the physical situation being modeled. Under errors in geometry, there are obvious errors in spatial geometry, but there are types of errors that might result from the fact that not all of the data is measured precisely at time to but rather over some interval of time. The chapter presents some examples of both types of perturbations of geometry.}

Since geodynamical understanding is the main purpose of seismic tomography, some suggestions are made on how to evolve from a predominantly qualitative to a more quantitative interpretation of its results. We argue that without a more systematic and realistic error and resolution analysis, interpretations might be misleading. Assuming a steady increase of data quality and coverage, the most challenging aspect of seismic tomography will be to take the nonlinearity of the problem fully into account.

  abstract = {Conventional gravity inversion techniques have limited ability to quantify structural uncertainty in geologic models. In this paper, a stochastic framework is proposed that directly incorporates fault-related and density-related uncertainty into the inversion process. The approach uses Monte Carlo simulation to generate model realizations and the gradual deformation method to further refine models to match observed data. To guarantee that model realizations are structurally restorable, fault displacements are generated using a kinematic modeling approach in which fault model properties such as the number of faults, location, dip, slip, and orientation are considered uncertain. Using a synthetic case study problem, a reference gravity field was inverted to generate a suite of posterior model realizations. Analysis of the posterior models was used to create a fault probability map as well as quantify the distribution of slip and dip of faults in three zones of deformation. Uncertainty in density values was found to be greatly reduced in the top 250~m depth, suggesting limited sensitivity to deeper sources in this example. Following the synthetic case study problem, the inversion approach was applied to a field-observed gravity profile in Dixie Valley, Nevada, and the inversion results were compared to a previously published forward gravity model. By generating a suite of posterior models, structural uncertainty can be better assessed to make more informed decisions in a host of subsurface modeling problems.},

  abstract = {Computational high throughput screening (HTS) has emerged as a significant tool in material science to accelerate the discovery of new materials with target properties in recent years. However, despite many successful cases in which HTS led to the novel discovery, currently, the major bottleneck in HTS is a large computational cost of density functional theory (DFT) calculations that scale cubically with system size, limiting the chemical space that can be explored. The present work aims at addressing this computational burden of HTS by presenting a machine learning (ML) framework that can efficiently explore the chemical space. Our model is built upon an existing crystal graph convolutional neural network (CGCNN) to obtain formation energy of a crystal structure but is modified to allow uncertainty quantification for each prediction using the hyperbolic tangent activation function and dropout algorithm (CGCNN-HD). The uncertainty quantification is particularly important since typical usage of CGCNN (due to the lack of gradient implementation) does not involve structural relaxation which could cause substantial prediction errors. The proposed method is benchmarked against an existing application that identified promising photoanode material among the {$>$}7,000 hypothetical Mg–Mn–O ternary compounds using all DFT-HTS. In our approach, we perform the approximate HTS using CGCNN-HD and refine the results using full DFT for those selected (denoted as ML/DFT-HTS). The proposed hybrid model reduces the required DFT calculations by a factor of {$>$}50 compared to the previous DFT-HTS in making the same discovery of Mg2MnO4, experimentally validated new photoanode material. Further analysis demonstrates that the addition of HD components with uncertainty measures in the CGCNN-HD model increased the discoverability of promising materials relative to all DFT-HTS from 30\% (CGCNN) to 68\% (CGCNN-HD). The present ML/DFT-HTS with uncertainty quantification can thus be a fast alternative to DFT-HTS for efficient exploration of the vast chemical space.},

Here, we develop an improved variant of the CGCNN model (iCGCNN) that outperforms the original by incorporating information of the Voronoi tessellated crystal structure, explicit 3-body correlations of neighboring constituent atoms, and an optimized chemical representation of interatomic bonds in the crystal graphs. We demonstrate the accuracy of the improved framework in two distinct illustrations: First, when trained/validated on 180,000/20,000 density functional theory (DFT) calculated thermodynamic stability entries taken from the Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD) and evaluated on a separate test set of 230,000 entries, iCGCNN achieves a predictive accuracy that is significantly improved, i.e., 20\% higher than that of the original CGCNN. Second, when used to assist high-throughput search for materials in the ThCr2Si2 structure-type, iCGCNN exhibited a success rate of 31\% which is 310 times higher than an undirected high-throughput search and 2.4 times higher than that of the original CGCNN. Using both CGCNN and iCGCNN, we screened 132,600 compounds with elemental decorations of the ThCr2Si2 prototype crystal structure and identified a total of 97 new unique stable compounds by performing 757 DFT calculations, accelerating the computational time of the high-throughput search by a factor of 130. Our results suggest that the iCGCNN can be used to accelerate high-throughput discoveries of new materials by quickly and accurately identifying crystalline compounds with properties of interest.},

  abstract = {Deep learning tools have gained tremendous attention in applied machine learning. However such tools for regression and classification do not capture model uncertainty. In comparison, Bayesian models offer a mathematically grounded framework to reason about model uncertainty, but usually come with a prohibitive computational cost. In this paper we develop a new theoretical framework casting dropout training in deep neural networks (NNs) as approximate Bayesian inference in deep Gaussian processes. A direct result of this theory gives us tools to model uncertainty with dropout NNs -- extracting information from existing models that has been thrown away so far. This mitigates the problem of representing uncertainty in deep learning without sacrificing either computational complexity or test accuracy. We perform an extensive study of the properties of dropout's uncertainty. Various network architectures and non-linearities are assessed on tasks of regression and classification, using MNIST as an example. We show a considerable improvement in predictive log-likelihood and RMSE compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, and finish by using dropout's uncertainty in deep reinforcement learning.},

  abstract = {Computational screening techniques have been found to be an effective alternative to the trial and error of experimentation for discovery of new materials. With increased interest in development of advanced electrical energy storage systems, it is essential to find new electrolytes that function effectively. This Perspective reviews various methods for screening electrolytes and then describes a hierarchical computational scheme to screen multiple properties of advanced electrical energy storage electrolytes using high-throughput quantum chemical calculations. The approach effectively down-selects a large pool of candidates based on successive property evaluation. As an example, results of screening are presented for redox potentials, solvation energies, and structural changes of ∼1400 organic molecules for nonaqueous redox flow batteries. Importantly, on the basis of high-throughput screening, in silico design of suitable candidate molecules for synthesis and electrochemical testing can be achieved. We anticipate that the computational approach described in this Perspective coupled with experimentation will have a significant role to play in the discovery of materials for future energy needs.},

Gaussian process regression (GPR) prediction based on optical absorption features guided the optimization process with promising prediction accuracy for PV parameters and burn-in losses. With ∼100 process conditions, screening for efficiency and photostability can be finished within 70 h. The highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14\% was achieved by fully automated device fabrication in air with a model material system PM6:Y6. Improving molecular ordering has been identified as the most promising motif for further efficiency optimization. Thin active layers combined with medium thermal annealing temperature are favorable to simultaneously improve efficiency and suppress burn-in losses.

CEP has established an automated, high-throughput, in silico framework to study potential candidate structures for organic photovoltaics. The current project phase is concerned with the characterization of millions of molecular motifs using first-principles quantum chemistry. The scale of this study requires a correspondingly large computational resource, which is provided by distributed volunteer computing on IBM’s World Community Grid. The results are compiled and analyzed in a reference database and will be made available for public use. In addition to finding specific candidates with certain properties, it is the goal of CEP to illuminate and understand the structure–property relations in the domain of organic electronics. Such insights can open the door to a rational and systematic design of future high-performance materials. The computational work in CEP is tightly embedded in a collaboration with experimentalists, who provide valuable input and feedback to the project.},

  abstract = {B6O is a member of icosahedral boron-rich solids known for their physical hardness and stability under irradiation bombardment, but it has also recently emerged as a promising high mobility p−type transparent conducting oxide. Using a combination of hybrid functional and many-body perturbation theory calculations, we report on the electronic structure and defect properties of this material. Our calculations identify B6O has a direct band gap in excess of 3.0 eV and possesses largely isotropic and low effective masses for both holes and electrons. Of the native defects, we identify no intrinsic origin to the reported p−type conductivity and confirm that p−type doping is not prevented by intrinsic defects such as oxygen vacancies, which we find act exclusively as neutral defects rather than hole-killing donors. We also investigate a number of common impurities and plausible dopants, finding that isolated acceptor candidates tend to yield deep states within the band gap or act instead as donors, and cannot account for p−type conductivity. Our calculations identify the only shallow acceptor candidate to be a complex consisting of interstitial H bonded to C substituting on the O site (CH)O. We therefore attribute the origins of p−type conductivity to these complexes formed during growth or more likely via isolated CO which later binds with H within the crystal. Lastly, we identify Si as a plausible n−type dopant, as it favorably acts as a shallow donor and does not suffer from self-compensation as may the C-related defects. Thus, in addition to the observed p−type conductivity, B6O exhibits promise of n−type dopability if the stoichiometry and both native and extrinsic sources of compensation can be sufficiently controlled.},

  abstract = {High-performance p-type transparent conducting materials (TCMs) are needed in a wide range of applications ranging from solar cells to transparent electronics. p-type TCMs require a large band gap (for transparency), low hole effective mass (for high mobility), and hole dopability. It has been demonstrated that oxides have inherent limitations in terms of hole effective masses making them difficult to use as a high-performance p-type TCM. In this work, we use a high-throughput computational approach to identify novel, non-oxide, p-type TCMs. By data mining a large computational data set (more than 30,000 compounds), we demonstrate that non-oxide materials can lead to much lower hole effective masses but to the detriment of smaller gaps and lower transparencies. We propose a strategy to overcome this fundamental correlation between low effective mass and small band gap by exploiting the weak absorption for indirect optical transitions. We apply this strategy to phosphides and identify zinc blende boron phosphide (BP) as a very promising candidate. Follow-up computational studies on defects formation indicate that BP can also be doped p-type and potentially n-type as well. Our work demonstrates how high-throughput computational design can lead to identification of materials with exceptional properties, and we propose a strategy to open the design of TCMs to non-oxide materials.}

  abstract = {We present recent advances in numerical implementations of hybrid functionals and the GW approximation within the full-potential linearized augmented-plane-wave (FLAPW) method. The former is an approximation for the exchange–correlation contribution to the total energy functional in density-functional theory, and the latter is an approximation for the electronic self-energy in the framework of many-body perturbation theory. All implementations employ the mixed product basis, which has evolved into a versatile basis for the products of wave functions, describing the incoming and outgoing states of an electron that is scattered by interacting with another electron. It can thus be used for representing the nonlocal potential in hybrid functionals as well as the screened interaction and related quantities in GW calculations. In particular, the six-dimensional space integrals of the Hamiltonian exchange matrix elements (and exchange self-energy) decompose into sums over vector–matrix–vector products, which can be evaluated easily. The correlation part of the GW self-energy, which contains a time or frequency dependence, is calculated on the imaginary frequency axis with a subsequent analytic continuation to the real axis or, alternatively, by a direct frequency convolution of the Green function G and the dynamically screened Coulomb interaction W along a contour integration path that avoids the poles of the Green function. Hybrid-functional and GW calculations are notoriously computationally expensive. We present a number of tricks that reduce the computational cost considerably, including the use of spatial and time-reversal symmetries, modifications of the mixed product basis with the aim to optimize it for the correlation self-energy and another modification that makes the Coulomb matrix sparse, analytic expansions of the interaction potentials around the point of divergence at k = 0, and a nested density and density-matrix convergence scheme for hybrid-functional calculations. We show CPU timings for prototype semiconductors and illustrative results for GdN and ZnO.},

  abstract = {Many-body perturbation theory is a well-established ab initio electronic-structure method based on Green functions. Although computationally more demanding than density functional theory, it has the distinct advantage that the exact expressions for all relevant observables, including the ground-state total energy, in terms of the Green function are known explicitly. The most important application, however, lies in the calculation of excited states, whose energies correspond directly to the poles of the Green function in the complex frequency plane. The accuracy of results obtained within this framework is only limited by the choice of the exchange-correlation self-energy, which must still be approximated in actual implementations. In this respect, the \textbackslash (GW\textbackslash ) approximation has proved highly successful for systems governed by the Coulomb interaction. It yields band structures of solids, including the band gaps of semiconductors, as well as atomic and molecular ionization energies in very good quantitative agreement with experimental photoemission data.}

We then find that ground-state generalized Kohn-Sham SRSH eigenvalues accurately reproduce the band structure obtained from GW calculations, typically to within 0.1–0.2 eV, and optical absorption spectra obtained using TDDFT with the SRSH functional agree well with those of GW-BSE, with a mean deviation of 0.03 and 0.11 eV for the location of the first and second absorption peaks, respectively, at a fraction of the computational cost.}

  abstract = {The successful exfoliation of graphene and other kinds of two-dimensional (2D) materials from their corresponding three-dimensional (3D) bulk counterparts has inspired researchers to screen layered bulk compounds as parent materials for potential 2D materials. With the rapid development of supercomputers and high-performance computations, high-throughput materials screening is a growing new power in materials science for the discovery of novel kinds of materials with desired functionality. Recently, many parent 3D bulks have been identified by high-throughput screening from materials databases for potential 2D materials, and several 2D materials databases are established through numerous efforts. In addition, on the basis of high-throughput computations for electronic properties and data-mining algorithms, several functional layered and 2D materials, such as electrode materials, photohydrolytic catalysts, half metals, piezoelectric monolayers and heterostructures, have been achieved. In this review, we summarize the recent progress in the high-throughput screening of parent candidates for 2D materials and their further applications, and the challenges and perspectives are also briefly discussed. We highly expect that this review could lead the way forward in the discovery of novel 2D materials and provide a guide for the further development of 2D materials.

  abstract = {Interfaces between normal and topological insulators are bound to host metallic states that are protected by time-reversal symmetry and are therefore robust against disorder and interface reconstruction. Two-dimensional topological insulators (quantum spin Hall insulators) offer a unique opportunity to change the local topology by adsorption of atoms or molecules and thus comprise an ideal platform for designing topological heterostructures. Here, we apply first principles calculations to show that the quantum spin Hall insulator 1T'-MoS2 exhibits a phase transition to a trivial insulator upon adsorption of various atoms. It is then demonstrated that one-dimensional metallic boundary states indeed arise in a ribbon geometry of alternating regions with and without adsorbed oxygen and that these boundary states generically constitute simple linear connections between valence and conduction bands. This is in sharp contrast to topological edge states that typically exhibit strong dispersion that are sensitively to a particular edge termination. The heterostructure is also suggestive of a simple design of one-dimensional metallic networks in sheets of 1T'-MoS2.}

Based on first principles calculations we find that, while the PbX systems are not topological insulators, all fluorinated PbX (PbXF2) compounds are 2D topological insulators. The quantum spin Hall insulating phase was confirmed by the explicitly calculation of the Z2 invariant. In addition we performed a thorough investigation of the role played by the (i) fluorine saturation, (ii) crystal field, and (iii) spin-orbital coupling in PbXF2. By considering nanoribbon structures, we verify the appearance of a pair of topologically protected Dirac-like edge states connecting the conduction and valence bands. The insulating phase which is a result of the spin orbit interaction, reveals that this new class of two dimensional materials present exceptional nontrivial band gaps, reaching values up to 0.99 eV at the Γ point, and an indirect band gap of 0.77 eV. The topological phase is arisen without any external field, making this system promising for nanoscale applications, using topological properties.}

This allows them to be exfoliated into so-called nanosheets, which can be micrometers wide but less than a nanometer thick. Such exfoliation leads to materials with extraordinary values of crystal surface area, in excess of 1000 square meters per gram. This can result in dramatically enhanced surface activity, leading to important applications, such as electrodes in supercapacitors or batteries. Another result of exfoliation is quantum confinement of electrons in two dimensions, transforming the electron band structure to yield new types of electronic and magnetic materials. Exfoliated materials also have a range of applications in composites as molecularly thin barriers or as reinforcing or conductive fillers. Here, we review exfoliation—especially in the liquid phase—as a transformative process in material science, yielding new and exotic materials, which are radically different from their bulk, layered counterparts.},

The advantages and disadvantages of each type of cavity are discussed. This will help the readers to decide which type of PhC cavities to use in particular applications. Furthermore, several integrated optical devices based on PhC cavities, such as optical filters, channel-drop filters, optical switches, and optical logic gates are described in both the working principle and operation characteristics.

  abstract = {In recent years, many researchers have shown their interest in producing a compact high-performance optical chip that is useful for most telecommunication applications. One of the solutions is by realising photonic crystal (PhC) structures that exhibit high-quality factors in a small mode volume, V. Silicon on insulator (SOI) is one of the main contenders due to its high-index contrast between the silicon (Si) core waveguide with silica (SiO 2 ) cladding surrounding it. The maturity of silicon photonic can also be incorporated with CMOS chips making it a desired material. A strong optical confinement provided by PhC structures makes it possible to realise the compact device on a single chip. In this chapter, we will discuss a fundamental background of photonic crystal cavities mainly on one-dimensional (1D) structures, which are the simplest as compared to their counterparts, 2D and 3D PhC device structures. We have modelled a photonic crystal cavity using finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) approach. This approach uses time-dependent Maxwell equation to cover wide frequency range in a single simulation. The results are then compared with the actual measured results showing a significant agreement between them. The design will be used as basic building block for designing a more complex PhC structures that exhibit high-quality factors for applications such as filtering, DWDM and sensors.}

  abstract = {CONSPECTUS: Colloidal photonic crystals (PhCs), periodically arranged monodisperse nanoparticles, have emerged as one of the most promising materials for light manipulation because of their photonic band gaps (PBGs), which affect photons in a manner similar to the effect of semiconductor energy band gaps on electrons. The PBGs arise due to the periodic modulation of the refractive index between the building nanoparticles and the surrounding medium in space with subwavelength period. This leads to light with certain wavelengths or frequencies located in the PBG being prohibited from propagating. Because of this special property, the fabrication and application of colloidal PhCs have attracted increasing interest from researchers. The most simple and economical method for fabrication of colloidal PhCs is the bottom-up approach of nanoparticle self-assembly. Common colloidal PhCs from this approach in nature are gem opals, which are made from the ordered assembly and deposition of spherical silica nanoparticles after years of siliceous sedimentation and compression. Besides naturally occurring opals, a variety of manmade colloidal PhCs with thin film or bulk morphology have also been developed. In principle, because of the effect of Bragg diffraction, these PhC materials show different structural colors when observed from different angles, resulting in brilliant colors and important applications. However, this angle dependence is disadvantageous for the construction of some optical materials and devices in which wide viewing angles are desired. Recently, a series of colloidal PhC materials with spherical macroscopic morphology have been created. Because of their spherical symmetry, the PBGs of spherical colloidal PhCs are independent of rotation under illumination of the surface at a fixed incident angle of the light, broadening the perspective of their applications. Based on droplet templates containing colloidal nanoparticles, these spherical colloidal PhCs can be generated by evaporation-induced nanoparticle crystallization or polymerization of ordered nanoparticle crystallization arrays. In particular, because microfluidics was used for the generation of the droplet templates, the development of spherical colloidal PhCs has progressed significantly. These new strategies not only ensure monodispersity, but also increase the structural and functional diversity of the PhC beads, paving the way for the development of advanced optoelectronic devices. In this Account, we present the research progress on spherical colloidal PhCs, including their design, preparation, and potential applications. We outline various types of spherical colloidal PhCs, such as close-packed, non-close-packed, inverse opal, biphasic or multiphasic Janus structured, and core-shell structured geometries. Based on their unique optical properties, applications of the spherical colloidal PhCs for displays, sensors, barcodes, and cell culture microcarriers are presented. Future developments of the spherical colloidal PhC materials are also envisioned.}

  abstract = {Nanofiller-modified materials have been widely explored for self-sensing in diverse venues spanning civil, aerospace, robotic, and even biomedical applications. Key to self-sensing is the fact that these materials are piezoresistive – their electrical conductivity is influenced by deformation and damage. Considerable research has aimed at leveraging this for intrinsic self-sensing. However, prevailing techniques provide no information about the underlying mechanical state of the material. Instead, damage and strain must be indirectly inferred from conductivity changes. The cause of this limitation is that recovering mechanics from electrical measurements is an ill-posed, under-determined, and multi-modal inverse problem. As such, global search algorithms coupled with physically motivated constraints must be used to obtain a solution. Previously, it was demonstrated that genetic algorithms (GAs) provide a suitable means of solving the displacement-from-conductivity problem. These algorithms, while undoubtedly powerful, suffer from artifacts in the strain solutions and variability in the solutions between successive searches. The goal of this work is to explore other commonly used global search algorithms which can be used to solve the displacement-from-conductivity inverse problem. In addition to GAs, we focus on two prevailing types of metaheuristic global search algorithms: simulated annealing and particle swarm optimization. Each algorithm is tested on experimental data where a self-sensing nanocomposite was deformed and electrical impedance tomography was used to image the conductivity change. The results for each algorithm are compared to standard finite element simulations and experimental observations via digital image correlation. A comparison is then drawn between the three algorithms in terms of solution quality, variability, accuracy, and computational efficiency.},

Self-sensing based on electrical resistance measurement is effective in continuous carbon fibre polymer matrix composites, which are important for aerospace structures. This effectiveness stems from the electrical conductivity of the carbon fibres and the consequent effect of the composite microstructure on the electrical resistivity of the composite. The volume, surface region and interlaminar interface of a carbon fibre composite laminate are all associated with electrical resistance, which serves to indicate the condition of the laminate. By using an array of electrical contacts, spatially distributed sensing is achieved. The strain and stress can be in the longitudinal (in-plane) direction, through-thickness direction or other directions of a laminate. In addition, the joint interface of a fastened joint between two laminates is associated with electrical resistance, which serves to indicate the condition of the joint.}

Damage sensing using electrical resistance in carbon fibre reinforced composite or using the fibres as optical sensing elements in glass fibre reinforced composite is demonstrated. Amelioration of low level damage is demonstrated in both monolithic composite materials and sandwich structures using direct chemical reactions within the matrix without the use of encapsulants. These reactions can be activated by resistive heating of the material itself. The use of a combination of these techniques could create a truly smart structure able to both sense and repair damage and degradation.}

Overall mechanical properties are larger for the solvent cast films concerning the 3D printed ones, particularly the elongation at break.

From the results, it is confirmed that the 2D TMD heterostructures can be a viable platform for highly sensitive, selective gas sensor applications without external bias due to their photovoltaic features.

Self-assembly methods were developed in our laboratory to fabricate 2-D particle array monolayers on mercury and water surfaces. These hexagonal arrays strongly forward Bragg diffract light to report on their array spacings. By embedding these 2-D arrays onto responsive hydrogel surfaces, 2-D PC sensing materials can be fabricated. The 2-D PC sensors utilize responsive polymer hydrogels that are chemically functionalized to show volume phase transitions in selective response to particular chemical species. Novel hydrogels were also developed in our laboratory by cross-linking proteins while preserving their native structures to maintain their selective binding affinities. The volume phase transitions swell or shrink the hydrogels, which alter their 2-D array spacings, and shift their diffraction wavelengths. These shifts can be visually detected or spectrally measured. These 2-D PC sensing materials have been used for the detection of many analytes, such as pH, surfactants, metal ions, proteins, anionic drugs, and ammonia. We are exploring the use of organogels that use low vapor pressure ionic liquids as their mobile phases for sensing atmospheric analytes.}

  abstract = {Two-dimensional materials have attracted great scientific attention due to their unusual and fascinating properties for use in electronics, spintronics, photovoltaics, medicine, composites, etc. Graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides such as MoS2, phosphorene, etc., which belong to the family of two-dimensional materials, have shown great promise for gas sensing applications due to their high surface-to-volume ratio, low noise and sensitivity of electronic properties to the changes in the surroundings. Two-dimensional nanostructured semiconducting metal oxide based gas sensors have also been recognized as successful gas detection devices. This review aims to provide the latest advancements in the field of gas sensors based on various two-dimensional materials with the main focus on sensor performance metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, detection limit, response time, and reversibility. Both experimental and theoretical studies on the gas sensing properties of graphene and other two-dimensional materials beyond graphene are also discussed. The article concludes with the current challenges and future prospects for two-dimensional materials in gas sensor applications.}

  abstract = {Self-sensing is valuable for structural materials, especially those for smart structures. It does not involve the use of embedded or attached sensors, as the structural material is itself the sensor. Self-sensing was attained in carbon-fiber–polymer-matrix structural composites by using the interlaminar interface (i.e., the interface between the laminae of continuous fibers) as a sensor. The attributes sensed were temperature, moisture, damage, and stress. In the case of temperature sensing, the interlaminar interface functioned as either a thermistor or a thermocouple junction. The thermocouple approach required the fibers in the contacting laminae to be dissimilar, whereas the thermistor approach did not. By using two crossply laminae, a two-dimensional array of sensors was attained for spatial distribution sensing.}

In recent years, two-dimensional (2D) materials have shown promising potential and prominent advantages in gas sensing technology, due to their unique physical and chemical properties. In addition, the ultra-high surface-to-volume ratio and surface activity of the 2D materials with atomic-level thickness enables enhanced absorption and sensitivity. Till now, different gas sensing techniques have been developed to further boost the performance of 2D materials-based gas sensors, such as various surface functionalization and Van der Waals heterojunction formation. In this article, a comprehensive review of advanced gas sensing devices is provided based on 2D materials, focusing on two sensing principles of charge-exchange and surface oxygen ion adsorption. Six types of typical gas sensor devices based on 2D materials are introduced with discussion of latest research progress and future perspectives.}

  abstract = {The advancement in spectral analysis methods for the emission spectrum of ruby has been driven by the characterization of R-line peak shifts with stress in order to establish piezospectroscopic relationships. These relationships form the basis for the development of photo-stimulated luminescence spectroscopy (PSLS) as a nondestructive method to determine the integrity of the thermally grown oxide (TGO) layer on jet engine turbine blades. Besides the measurement technique, the accuracy of PSLS in stress measurements is influenced by the spectral analysis methodology, which is the focus of this paper. Gradient-based algorithms have been used widely in the methods developed thus far. The approach of using genetic algorithms in the spectral analysis of R-lines and vibronic bands is presented here for the first time and validated with the well-known piezospectroscopic coefficients of the R-lines. The implementation of this method has led to significant new results in the quantification of peak shifts with uniaxial stress in the vibronic bands of the spectrum. The use of genetic algorithms is instrumental in the deconvolution and fitting of the numerous peaks in these bands. Fitting statistics, such as the fitness function and number of function evaluations, were used to assess the effectiveness of the procedures used in this method.},

  abstract = {Conductive nanocomposites have been explored extensively for structural health monitoring (SHM) due to their self-sensing nature via the piezoresistive effect. Combined with a non-invasive conductivity imaging modality such as electrical impedance tomography (EIT), piezoresistivity is a powerful tool for SHM. To date, however, the combination of the piezoresistive effect and EIT has been limited to just damage detection. From a SHM perspective, it may be more beneficial to pre-emptively predict failure before it occurs. To that end, we propose a novel methodology for failure prediction in nanocomposites using piezoresistive inversion. Our approach makes use of a genetic algorithm (GA) to determine the mechanical state of the structure using conductivity changes observed via EIT. First, a rectangular nanocomposite specimen with a central hole is manufactured. Second, the specimen is loaded in tension to induce stress concentrations near the hole. Third, EIT is used to image the resulting stress concentration-induced conductivity changes near the hole. Fourth, GA-enabled piezoresistive inversion is implemented to determine the underlying displacements from the observed conductivity changes. The strains are then determined from kinematic relations and the stresses from constitutive relations. Lastly, a failure criterion is used to predict failure. By validating our results with finite element analysis and digital image correlation, we demonstrate that the proposed approach can accurately predict the onset of failure and therefore enable unprecedented SHM capabilities in piezoresistive nanocomposites.},

  abstract = {We present a specially designed evolutionary algorithm for the prediction of surface reconstructions. This technique allows one to automatically explore stable and low-energy metastable configurations with variable surface atoms and variable surface unit cells through the whole chemical potential range. The power of evolutionary search is demonstrated by the efficient identification of diamond 2×1 (100) and 2×1 (111) surface reconstructions with a fixed number of surface atoms and a fixed cell size. With further variation of surface unit cells, we study the reconstructions of the polar surface MgO (111). Experiment has detected an oxygen trimer (ozone) motif [Plass et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 81, 4891 (1998)]. We predict another version of this motif which can be thermodynamically stable in extreme oxygen-rich conditions. Finally, we perform a variable stoichiometry search for a complex ternary system: semipolar GaN (10¯11) with and without adsorbed oxygen. The search yields a counterintuitive reconstruction based on N3 trimers. These examples demonstrate that an automated scheme to explore the energy landscape of surfaces will improve our understanding of surface reconstructions. The method presented in this paper can be generally applied to binary and multicomponent systems.},

However, such 2D boron monolayers have still not been synthesized. In this report, the synthesis of atomically thin 2D γ-boron films on copper foils is achieved by chemical vapor deposition using a mixture of pure boron and boron oxide powders as the boron source and hydrogen gas as the carrier gas. Strikingly, the optical band gap of the boron film was measured to be around 2.25 eV, which is close to the value (2.07 eV) determined by first-principles calculations, suggesting that the γ-B28 monolayer is a fascinating direct band gap semiconductor. Furthermore, a strong photoluminescence emission band was observed at approximately 626 nm, which is again due to the direct band gap. This study could pave the way for applications of two-dimensional boron materials in electronic and photonic devices.},

We compare the performance of these two approaches applied to the problem of structure prediction of the titania polymorphs. A number of well-known phases have thus been reproduced as well as several plausible novel microporous and dense structures. Two different potential parameter sets, within the Born model description of a solid, were employed. Following the Lamarckian concept in a genetic or more generally in an evolutionary algorithm, all new candidate structures are immediately relaxed (analogous to the ageing process in nature); consequently, competition within any current population to procreate only occurs between mature candidate structures, which correspond to local minima on the energy landscape. In the Darwinian scheme, no local optimisation is performed, which should result in significant saving in CPU time per candidate structure considered. We show, however, that the Lamarckian scheme (which ultimately searches for the global minimum on a simplified landscape) is more successful and efficient at generating the target structures. Analysis of why the Lamarckian scheme produced a perfect success rate uncovered a weakness in the Darwinian approach when diversity of the population is allowed to reduce, and further methodological developments are suggested.},

Since the successful isolation of graphene and other twodimensional (2D) materials, there has been a strong focus on spintronics based on 2D materials due to their attractive properties, and much progress has been made, both theoretically and experimentally. Here, we summarize recent developments in spintronics based on 2D materials. We focus mainly on materials of truly 2D nature, that is, atomic crystal layers such as graphene, phosphorene, monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides, and others, but also highlight current research foci in heterostructures or interfaces. In particular, we emphasize roles played by computation based on firstprinciples methods which has contributed significantly in the designs of spintronic materials and devices.

  abstract = {It has been long hoped that the realization of long-range ferromagnetic order in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) crystals, combined with their rich electronic and optical properties, would open up new possibilities for magnetic, magnetoelectric and magneto-optic applications. However, in 2D systems, the long-range magnetic order is strongly hampered by thermal fluctuations which may be counteracted by magnetic anisotropy, according to the Mermin-Wagner theorem. Prior efforts via defect and composition engineering, and proximity effect only locally or extrinsically introduce magnetic responses. Here we report the first experimental discovery of intrinsic long-range ferromagnetic order in pristine Cr2Ge2Te6 atomic layers by scanning magneto-optic Kerr microscopy. In such a 2D vdW soft ferromagnet, for the first time, an unprecedented control of transition temperature of \textasciitilde{} 35\% - 57\% enhancement is realized via surprisingly small fields ({$<$}= 0.3 Tesla in this work), in stark contrast to the stiffness of the transition temperature to magnetic fields in the three-dimensional regime. We found that the small applied field enables an effective anisotropy far surpassing the tiny magnetocrystalline anisotropy, opening up a sizable spin wave excitation gap. Confirmed by renormalized spin wave theory, we explain the phenomenon and conclude that the unusual field dependence of transition temperature constitutes a hallmark of 2D soft ferromagnetic vdW crystals. Our discovery of 2D soft ferromagnetic Cr2Ge2Te6 presents a close-to-ideal 2D Heisenberg ferromagnet for studying fundamental spin behaviors, and opens the door for exploring new applications such as ultra-compact spintronics.},

Recent additions include spin-valley coupled semiconductors, Ising superconductors that can be tuned into a quantum metal, possible Mott insulators with tunable charge-density waves, and topological semi-metals with edge transport. Despite this progress, there is still no 2D crystal with intrinsic magnetism, which would be useful for many technologies such as sensing, information, and data storage. Theoretically, magnetic order is prohibited in the 2D isotropic Heisenberg model at finite temperatures by the Mermin-Wagner theorem. However, magnetic anisotropy removes this restriction and enables, for instance, the occurrence of 2D Ising ferromagnetism. Here, we use magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) microscopy to demonstrate that monolayer chromium triiodide (CrI3) is an Ising ferromagnet with out-of-plane spin orientation. Its Curie temperature of 45 K is only slightly lower than the 61 K of the bulk crystal, consistent with a weak interlayer coupling. Moreover, our studies suggest a layer-dependent magnetic phase transition, showcasing the hallmark thickness-dependent physical properties typical of van der Waals crystals. Remarkably, bilayer CrI3 displays suppressed magnetization with a metamagnetic effect, while in trilayer the interlayer ferromagnetism observed in the bulk crystal is restored. Our work creates opportunities for studying magnetism by harnessing the unique features of atomically-thin materials, such as electrical control for realizing magnetoelectronics, and van der Waals engineering for novel interface phenomena.},

The ferromagnetic mono- and few-layer 2D CrSiTe3 indicated here should enable numerous applications in nano-spintronics.},

  abstract = {The recent progress of spin injection, spin transport, spin manipulation, and application in 2D materials was summarized. The current challenges and outlook of future studies in spintronics based on 2D materials and related heterostructures were discussed. Spintronics, exploiting the spin degree of electrons as the information vector, is an attractive field for implementing the beyond Complemetary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) devices. Recently, two-dimensional (2D) materials have been drawing tremendous attention in spintronics owing to their distinctive spin-dependent properties, such as the ultra-long spin relaxation time of graphene and the spin–valley locking of transition metal dichalcogenides. Moreover, the related heterostructures provide an unprecedented probability of combining the different characteristics via proximity effect, which could remedy the limitation of individual 2D materials. Hence, the proximity engineering has been growing extremely fast and has made significant achievements in the spin injection and manipulation. Nevertheless, there are still challenges toward practical application; for example, the mechanism of spin relaxation in 2D materials is unclear, and the high-efficiency spin gating is not yet achieved. In this review, we focus on 2D materials and related heterostructures to systematically summarize the progress of the spin injection, transport, manipulation, and application for information storage and processing. We also highlight the current challenges and future perspectives on the studies of spintronic devices based on 2D materials.}

Our X-ray diffraction studies reveal a first-order crystallographic phase transition occurring near 210–220 K upon warming, with significant thermal hysteresis. The low-temperature structure is rhombohedral (R3̅, BiI3-type) and the high-temperature structure is monoclinic (C2/m, AlCl3-type). We find evidence for coupling between the crystallographic and magnetic degrees of freedom in CrI3, observing an anomaly in the interlayer spacing at the Curie temperature and an anomaly in the magnetic susceptibility at the structural transition. First-principles calculations reveal the importance of proper treatment of the long-ranged interlayer forces, and van der Waals density functional theory does an excellent job of predicting the crystal structures and their relative stability. Calculations also suggest that the ferromagnetic order found in the bulk material may persist into monolayer form, suggesting that CrI3 and other chromium trihalides may be promising materials for spintronic and magnetoelectronic research.},

Nevertheless, their experimental realization remains a big challenge. Through first-principles calculations, we here demonstrate the possibility of realizing 2D ferromagnetic semiconductors simply by exfoliating layered crystals of CrXTe3 (X = Si, Ge). The exfoliation of CrXTe3 is feasible due to its small cleavage energy, and CrXTe3 nanosheets can form free-standing membranes. Interestingly, upon exfoliation, the ferromagnetism and semiconducting character are well preserved from bulk to the nanosheet form. Long-range ferromagnetic order with a magnetization of 3 μB per Cr atom is confirmed in 2D CrXTe3 from classical Heisenberg model Monte Carlo simulations. Both bulk and 2D CrXTe3 are indirect-gap semiconductors with their valence and conduction bands fully spin-polarized in the same direction, which is promising for spin-polarized carrier injection and detection. We further demonstrate the tunability and enrichment of the properties of CrXTe3 nanosheets via external operations. Under moderate tensile strain, the 2D ferromagnetism can be largely enhanced. By pure electron doping or adsorbing nucleophilic molecules, CrXTe3 nanosheets become 2D half metals.},

  abstract = {A fundamental part of geophysics is to make inferences about the interior of the earth on the basis of data collected at or near the surface of the earth. In almost all cases these measured data are only indirectly related to the properties of the earth that are of interest, so an inverse problem must be solved in order to obtain estimates of the physical properties within the earth. In February of 1999 the U.S. Department of Energy sponsored a workshop that was intended to examine the methods currently being used to solve geophysical inverse problems and to consider what new approaches should be explored in the future. The interdisciplinary area between inverse problems in geophysics and optimization methods in mathematics was specifically targeted as one where an interchange of ideas was likely to be fruitful. Thus about half of the participants were actively involved in solving geophysical inverse problems and about half were actively involved in research on general optimization methods. This report presents some of the topics that were explored at the workshop and the conclusions that were reached. In general, the objective of a geophysical inverse problem is to find an earth model, described by a setmore » of physical parameters, that is consistent with the observational data. It is usually assumed that the forward problem, that of calculating simulated data for an earth model, is well enough understood so that reasonably accurate synthetic data can be generated for an arbitrary model. The inverse problem is then posed as an optimization problem, where the function to be optimized is variously called the objective function, misfit function, or fitness function. The objective function is typically some measure of the difference between observational data and synthetic data calculated for a trial model. However, because of incomplete and inaccurate data, the objective function often incorporates some additional form of regularization, such as a measure of smoothness or distance from a prior model. Various other constraints may also be imposed upon the process. Inverse problems are not restricted to geophysics, but can be found in a wide variety of disciplines where inferences must be made on the basis of indirect measurements. For instance, most imaging problems, whether in the field of medicine or non-destructive evaluation, require the solution of an inverse problem. In this report, however, the examples used for illustration are taken exclusively from the field of geophysics. The generalization of these examples to other disciplines should be straightforward, as all are based on standard second-order partial differential equations of physics. In fact, sometimes the non-geophysical inverse problems are significantly easier to treat (as in medical imaging) because the limitations on data collection, and in particular on multiple views, are not so severe as they generally are in geophysics. This report begins with an introduction to geophysical inverse problems by briefly describing four canonical problems that are typical of those commonly encountered in geophysics. Next the connection with optimization methods is made by presenting a general formulation of geophysical inverse problems. This leads into the main subject of this report, a discussion of methods for solving such problems with an emphasis upon newer approaches that have not yet become prominent in geophysics. A separate section is devoted to a subject that is not encountered in all optimization problems but is particularly important in geophysics, the need for a careful appraisal of the results in terms of their resolution and uncertainty. The impact on geophysical inverse problems of continuously improving computational resources is then discussed. The main results are then brought together in a final summary and conclusions section. « less}

  abstract = {Abstract The following general question is addressed: what can be learned about a planetary interior from measurements of the global planetary magnetic field at (or near) its surface? The discussion is placed in the context of Earth, for clarity, but the considerations apply to terrestrial planets in general (so long as the observed magnetism is either predominantly of internal origin, or else external source effects can be successfully filtered out of the observations). Attention is given to the idealized but typical situation of a rotating but spherically symmetric planet containing a highly conducting uniform fluid core surrounded by a nearly insulating rigid mantle, whose conductivity, a function of at most radius only, falls monotonically from its largest value at the base of the planetary mantle to zero at the planetary surface; the largest value of mantle conductivity as well as the mean value for the whole mantle and the mantle conductance are assumed small compared to the corresponding values of the core. Exterior to the planet is vacuum in the sense of an electrically uncharged insulator. The core fluid is inviscid, Boussinesq and gravitationally driven. Complete and perfect observations of either the instantaneous internal vector magnetic field together with its secular variation at a single epoch, or more realistically, the instantaneous internal vector magnetic field alone at two separated epochs are presumed available; the time separation between measurement epochs is long compared the Ohmic diffusion time of the planetary mantle, but small compared to that of the liquid core. Under such circumstances we describe how information about each of the following planetary properties can, in principle (though not without practical difficulty) be retrieved from the observations: (1) depth of the core-mantle boundary (a result of Hide); (2) depth to the current and motion sources responsible for the planetary dynamo; (3) presence or absence of small-scale turbulence in the upper reaches of the core; (4) large-scale horizontal fluid motion at the top of the core; (5) strength of horizontal currents, zonal magnetic fields, Coriolis and Lorentz forces at the top of the core; and (6) current system in the mantle and strength of electromagnetic core-mantle coupling.}

  abstract = {SUMMARY Using the 2-D DC-resistivity tomography experiment as an example, we examine some of the difficulties inherently associated with constructing a single maximally smooth model as a solution to a geophysical inverse problem. We argue that this conventional approach yields at best only a single model from a myriad, of possible models and at worst produces a model which, although having minimum structure, frequently has little useful relation to the earth that gave rise to the observed data. In fact in applied geophysics it is usual to have significant prior information which is to be supplemented by further geophysical experiments. With, this perspective we suggest an alternate approach to geophysical inverse problems which emphasizes the prior information and includes the data from the geophysical experiment as a supplementary constraint. To this end we take all available prior information and construct an inversion algorithm which, given an arbitrary starting model and the absence of any data, will produce a preconceived earth model and then introduce the observed data into the inversion to determine how the prior earth model is influenced by the supplementary geophysical data.}

Geophysical inversions such as impedance inversion, amplitude-variation-with-offset inversion, and traveltime tomography are commonly used in the industry to yield physical properties from measured seismic data. Machine learning, a data-driven approach, has become popular during the past decades and is useful for solving such inverse problems. An advantage of machine learning methods is that they can be implemented without knowledge of physical equations or theories. The challenges of machine learning lie in acquiring enough training data and selecting relevant parameters, which are essential in obtaining a good quality model. In this study, we compare geophysical inversion and machine learning approaches in solving inverse problems and show similarities and differences of these approaches in a mathematical form and numerical tests. Both methods aid in solving ill-posed and nonlinear problems and use similar optimization techniques. We take reflectivity inversion as an example of the inverse problem. We apply geophysical inversion based on the least-squares method and artificial neural networks as a machine learning approach to solve reflectivity inversion using 2D synthetic data sets and 3D field data sets. A neural network with multiple hidden layers successfully generates the nonlinear mapping function to predict reflectivity. For this inverse problem, we test different L1 regularizers for both approaches. L1 regularization alleviates effects of noise in seismic traces and enhances sparsity, especially in the least-squares method. The 2D synthetic wedge model and field data examples show that neural networks yield high spatial resolution.}

When the system is unknown, it can be estimated, together with the noise variance, by using a stochastic version of EM algorithm.

The main goal of this paper is to propose a step forward toward such a framework, focussing on the discrete inverse problems, that are used in practical applications. The relevance of information and measurements (real world data) for the definition of the calibration target and of the objective function is discussed, in particular with reference to the Bayesian approach. Identifiability of model parameters, posedness (uniqueness and stability) and conditioning of the inverse problems are formally defined. The proposed framework is so general as to permit rigorous definitions and treatment of sensitivity analysis, adjoint-state approach, multi-objective optimization.}

  abstract = {An important aspect of the physical sciences is to make inferences about physical parameters from data. In general, the laws of physics provide the means for computing the data values given a model. This is called the “forward problem”, see figure 1. In the inverse problem, the aim is to reconstruct the model from a set of measurements. In the ideal case, an exact theory exists that prescribes how the data should be transformed in order to reproduce the model. For some selected examples such a theory exists assuming that the required infinite and noise-free data sets would be available. A quantum mechanical potential in one spatial dimension can be reconstructed when the reflection coefficient is known for all energies [Marchenko, 1955; Burridge, 1980]. This technique can be generalized for the reconstruction of a quantum mechanical potential in three dimensions [Newton, 1989], but in that case a redundant data set is required for reasons that are not well understood. The mass-density in a one-dimensional string can be constructed from the measurements of all eigenfrequencies of that string [Borg,1946], but due to the symmetry of this problem only the even part of the mass-density can be determined. If the seismic velocity in the earth depends only on depth, the velocity can be constructed exactly from the measurement of the arrival time as a function of distance of seismic waves using an Abel transform [Herglotz, 1907; Wiechert, 1907]. Mathematically this problem is identical to the construction of a spherically symmetric quantum mechanical potential in three dimensions [Keller et al., 1956]. However, the construction method of Herglotz-Wiechert only gives an unique result when the velocity increases monotonically with depth [Gerver and Markushevitch, 1966]. This situation is similar in quantum mechanics where a radially symmetric potential can only be constructed uniquely when the potential does not have local minima [Sabatier, 1973].}

  abstract = {The inverse problem for gross earth data can be reduced to an undertermined linear system of integral equations of the first kind. A theory is discussed for computing particular solutions to this linear system based on the stochastic inverse theory presented by Franklin. The stochastic inverse is derived and related to the generalized inverse of Penrose and Moore. A Backus-Gilbert type tradeoff curve is constructed for the problem of estimating the solution to the linear system in the presence of noise. It is shown that the stochastic inverse represents an optimal point on this tradeoff curve. A useful form of the solution autocorrelation operator as a member of a one-parameter family of smoothing operators is derived.}

  abstract = {Non-invasive studies of the shallow Earth are an essential element in a broad range of earth science disciplines. Such studies are usually accomplished using geophysical techniques, which means that a geophysical inverse problem must be solved. Unfortunately, non-uniqueness is a basic property of almost all solutions to geophysical inverse problems. In this paper we describe a method of dealing with this non-uniqueness which we believe is more direct, more complete, and more informative than previous attempts in this area. Instead of using regularization methods to constrain the non-uniqueness of geophysical inverse problems, we confront directly the non-uniqueness and attempt to describe it. The basic technique is to generate and describe a collection of models that fit the data within acceptable limits based upon observational errors. This collection of models, called an ensemble, is analysed with statistical methods in order to characterize the uncertainty in the solution and also make inferences about properties that are shared by all acceptable models. A by-product of this approach is that it produces basic information about the degree of linearity contained in the problem and maps trade-offs between various parameters. The method proposed is quite general and should be applicable to a broad range of geophysical inverse problems. We illustrate the basic method by applying it to two typical geophysical problems. The first application is to a set of cross-borehole traveltime observations gathered in Kesterson, California. The small deviations of the observed traveltime residuals from those predicted by a uniform half-space indicates that the velocity contrasts are not large. The set of acceptable models appears to form a non-degenerate hyperellipsoid in the model space. The mean of the velocity models converges quite rapidly to a smoothed version of a linearized singular-value decomposition solution. The velocity variations agree very well with the results of a hydrological tracer test conducted prior to the seismic experiment. The second application is to the problem of simultaneously estimating the shape and density of a constant density body using surface gravity measurements. In this case a linear analysis is found to be inadequate. A quadratic formulation is necessary to accurately represent the trade-off between the magnitude of the density perturbation and the depth extent of the body.}

  abstract = {Many geophysical inverse problems derive from governing partial differential equations with unknown coefficients. Alternatively, inverse problems often arise from integral equations associated with a Green’s function solution to a governing differential equation. In their discrete form such equations reduce to systems of polynomial equations, known as algebraic equations. Using techniques from computational algebra one can address questions of the existence of solutions to such equations as well as the uniqueness of the solutions. The techniques are enumerative and exhaustive, requiring a finite number of computer operations. For example, calculating a bound to the total number of solutions reduces to computing the dimension of a linear vector space. The solution set itself may be constructed through the solution of an eigenvalue problem. The techniques are applied to a set of synthetic magnetotelluric values generated by conductivity variations within a layer. We find that the estimation of the conductivity and the electric field in the subsurface, based upon single-frequency magnetotelluric field values, is equivalent to a linear inverse problem. The techniques are also illustrated by an application to a magnetotelluric data set gathered at Battle Mountain, Nevada. Surface observations of the electric (Ey) and magnetic (Hx) fields are used to construct a model of subsurface electrical structure. Using techniques for algebraic equations it is shown that solutions exist, and that the set of solutions is finite. The total number of solutions is bounded above at 134 217 728. A numerical solution of the algebraic equations generates a conductivity structure in accordance with the current geological model for the area.}

The imaging methods attempt to provide an image of the defect at variance of commercial instruments that, generally, detect the defect and may have limited capabilities of extracting its major sizes by means of calibration curves obtained in predened conditions. In addition, numerical models of the probe-defect interaction (direct problem) play a relevant role for the computer aided design of the probe, where commercial codes typically fail to treat this kind of problems. In this thesis we present methods for the solution of both the direct and the inverse problems in ECT.

The presence of ferromagnetic materials (the steel bars of the reinforcement) immersed in the concrete disturbs the magnetic field at the surface of the structure. These field alterations are detected by sensors coils placed on the concrete surface. Variations in position and cross section (the size) of steel bars immersed in concrete originate slightly different values for the induced voltages at the coils. . The values for the induced voltages were obtained in laboratory tests, and multi-layer perceptron artificial neural networks with Levemberg-Marquardt training algorithm were used to identify the location and size of the bar.

Therefore, non-destructive methods like radioscopy, ultrasound, optical or thermal imaging increasingly gain in importance with respect to ongoing product and material development in the different phases like material characterization, production control or module reliability testing. Because of the manifold different application fields, i.e., certain physical NDT methods applied to material inspection, characterization or reliability testing, this contribution will focus on the radioscopic-based methods related to their most important applications. Today, in modern industrial quality control, X-ray transmission is used in two different ways: • Two-dimensional radioscopic transmission imaging (projection technique), usually applied to inline inspection tasks in application fields like lightweight material production, electronic component soldering or food production. • Computed tomography (CT) for generation of three-dimensional data, representing spatial information and density distribution of objects. CT application fields are on the one hand the understanding of production process failure or component and module inspection (completeness) and on the other hand the dimensional measuring of hidden geometrical outlines (metrology). This paper demonstrates the methods including technical set-ups (X-ray source and detector), imaging and reconstruction results and the methods for high speed and high-resolution volume data generation and evaluation.}

As a matter of fact, the latter task can be accomplished with rather simple inverse algorithms, which rely on the linearization of the elastic and/or electromagnetic wave inverse scattering problem. Nevertheless, in particular in safety relevant applications like nuclear power generation, aircraft and/or bridge testing, one is interested to extract the maximum amount of information from the data utilizing all a priori knowledge of the physical model under concern, for instance with regard to the propagation characteristics of the defect embedding medium or with regard to the polarization of the wave mode. In that sense, some recent fundamental improvements of linear diffraction tomographic inverse scattering have been made, which will be summarized and commented upon in the present article. In addition, a novel philosophy of computer aided nondestructive testing will be discussed, which comes under the alias ULIAS: Ultrasonic Inspection Applying Simulation. The key idea is to support the assessment of the output of existing imaging algorithms with simulations applying numerical techniques to compute wave propagation and scattering for the testing problem under concern; the resulting synthetic data supply a testbed for the inverse problem.}

Experimental outcomes prove that typical WAAM defects can be detected by the referred techniques.

  abstract = {For decades, aircraft disasters have always been a concern for airline companies and especially for consumers. Scientists all over the world have been constantly trying to study, discover and invent new methods for testing and prevention to reduce future aircraft accidents. One of those methods is non-destructive testing, which is a widely adaptive process for analyzing structural integrity over wide arrays of object. X-rays, ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) are non-destructive testing applications commonly used for the commercial aircraft maintenance. These non-destructive testing methods for aircraft structures give us high-quality images of structural damage but, there are some disadvantages related to resolution and the contrast mechanism of the image. The goal of this study is to demonstrate the concept of X-Ray Induced Acoustic Computed Tomography (XACT) imaging method for defect detection and localization through simulations using k-wave MATLAB toolbox. XACT is a technique based on the X-ray induced acoustic effect. In XACT, a short pulsed of X-rays are required to achieve thermal response and generate acoustic waves. X-ray travels to an object, the photons are absorbed causing the temperature in the object to raise, which generates acoustic waves due to thermoelastic expansion. These acoustic waves are then detected by ultrasonic transducers. Within the fuselage of the aircraft, the aircraft’s stiffener is designed using SolidWorks. along with two different types of defects through voids due to manufacturing imperfection process. As well as, cracks in the surface of the model due to mechanical failures are created in MATLAB. Two properties of Aluminum 6065 and Inconel 625 materials were selected for our simulation study since it is often used for the fuselage and/or aircraft engines. XACT images are generated under the combination of high X-ray absorption and ultrasonic transducers that will be able to overcome the disadvantages of the X-ray imaging technique and ultrasound imaging technique in image resolution and contrast mechanisms. The results from this simulation study demonstrate that the XACT method not only gives us high-resolution images but moreover, higher contrast of images that also allows us to detect position accuracy of the cons created.},

We establish a first-order linear partial differential equation relating the assigned family of light rays with all possible refractive indexes compatible with this family.

Unfortunately, the number of possible combinations is so vast, and the electronic properties are so sensitive to the details of the crystal structure, that simple trial-and-error methods (such as those used in combinatorial synthesis) are unlikely to be successful. Here we describe a theoretical method that addresses the problem of finding the atomic configuration of a complex, multi-component system having a target electronic-structure property.

  abstract = {Abstract Three classes of inverse coefficient problems arising in engineering mechanics and computational material science are considered. Mathematical models of all considered problems are proposed within the J2-deformation theory of plasticity. The first class is related to the determination of unknown elastoplastic properties of a beam from a limited number of torsional experiments. The inverse problem here consists of identifying the unknown coefficient g ( ξ 2 ) (plasticity function) in the non-linear differential equation of torsional creep  ( g ( | u | 2 ) u x 1 ) x 1  ( g ( | u | 2 ) u x 2 ) x 2 = 2 φ , x Ω R 2 , from the torque (or torsional rigidity) T ( φ ) , given experimentally. The second class of inverse problems is related to the identification of elastoplastic properties of a 3D body from spherical indentation tests. In this case one needs to determine unknown Lame coefficients in the system of PDEs of non-linear elasticity, from the measured spherical indentation loading curve P = P ( α ) , obtained during the quasi-static indentation test. In the third model an inverse problem of identifying the unknown coefficient g ( ξ 2 ( u ) ) in the non-linear bending equation is analyzed. The boundary measured data here is assumed to be the deflections w i [ τ k ] w ( λ i ; τ k ) , measured during the quasi-static bending process, given by the parameter τ k , k = 1 , K ̄  , at some points λ i = ( x 1 ( i ) , x 2 ( i ) ) , i = 1 , M ̄  of a plate. An existence of weak solutions of all direct problems are derived in appropriate Sobolev spaces, by using monotone potential operator theory. Then monotone iteration schemes for all the linearized direct problems are proposed. Strong convergence of solutions of the linearized problems, as well as rates of convergence is proved. Based on obtained continuity property of the direct problem solution with respect to coefficients, and compactness of the set of admissible coefficients, an existence of quasi-solutions of all considered inverse problems is proved. Some numerical results, useful from the points of view of engineering mechanics and computational material science, are demonstrated.}

  abstract = {We use the problem of determining nematic liquid crystal director profiles from optical measurements as an example to illustrate that what is often treated purely as a data fitting problem is really an inverse problem and that useful insights can be obtained by treating it in this way. Specifically we illustrate the analysis of the sufficiency of data and the sensitivity of a solution to measurement errors. We assume a stratified medium where the Berreman method can be used for the optical forward problem and we consider the inverse problem to be the determination of an anisotropic dielectric permittivity tensor from optical data. A numerical singular value decomposition (SVD) analysis reveals that although this inverse problem is severely ill-conditioned it is possible to determine depth-dependent information provided the medium is sufficiently birefringent and that, as one might expect, a larger range of incident angles gives greater information. Analytical solutions of the Berreman equations for general perturbations of an orthorhombic crystal confirm the uniqueness of solution for the linearized problem and give further insights into the severely ill-posed nature of the inverse problem.}

Unfortunately, numerous factors render this process labour intensive and error prone. Experimental conditions, such as high pressure or structural metastability, often complicate characterization. Furthermore, many materials of great modern interest, such as batteries and hydrogen storage media, contain light elements such as Li and H that only weakly scatter X-rays. Finally, structural refinements generally require significant human input and intuition, as they rely on good initial guesses for the target structure. To address these many challenges, we demonstrate a new hybrid approach, first-principles-assisted structure solution (FPASS), which combines experimental diffraction data, statistical symmetry information and first-principles-based algorithmic optimization to automatically solve crystal structures. We demonstrate the broad utility of FPASS to clarify four important crystal structure debates: the hydrogen storage candidates MgNH and NH(3)BH(3); Li(2)O(2), relevant to Li-air batteries; and high-pressure silane, SiH(4).}

  abstract = {THE prediction of the structure of inorganic crystalline solids from the knowledge of their chemical composition is still a largely unresolved problem1–3. The usual approach to this problem is to minimize, for a selection of candidate models, the potential energy of the system with respect to the structural parameters of these models: the solution is the arrangement that comes out lowest in energy. Methods using this procedure may differ in the origin (ab initio or empirical) of the interatomic potentials used, but they usually restrict themselves to optimizing a structural arrangement within the constraints of given symmetry and bond topology. As a result, they do not truly address the problem of predicting the unknown structure of a real compound. The method we describe here is an attempt at solving the following problem: given the chemical composition of a crystalline compound and the values of its unit-cell parameters, find its structure (topology and bond distances) by optimizing the arrangement of ions, atoms or molecules in accordance with a set of prescribed rules. The procedure uses simple, empirical crystal chemistry arguments (Pauling's principles for ionic compounds4) and a powerful stochastic search procedure, known as simulated annealing5 to identify the best atomic model or models. We discuss the potential of the method for structure determination and refinement, using results obtained for several known inorganic structures, and by the determination of a previously unknown structure. Although the approach is limited to the case of inorganic compounds, it is nevertheless very general, and would apply to any crystalline structure provided that the principles governing the architecture of the solid can be properly described.}

However, these methods have limitations, either in accessibly (domain expertise), accuracy, and/or throughput \&nbsp;[1]. Consequently, the material search space remains underexplored, given order 10⁵ reported compounds compared to order 10¹⁰ theorized ternary compounds [2]. To accelerate the exploration of new solid-state materials, a framework capable of inverse design for materials with user-defined properties is needed. Herein, we present a generalized framework for inverse design of crystals with user-defined properties, which include both ground-state and excited-state properties (\emph{e.g.}, thermoelectric power factor) using sparsely labelled training data. The key enabler of this inverse-design framework is a general and invertible crystallographic representation that encodes the crystallographic information into the representations in both real space and reciprocal space. The trained surrogate model achieves similar property prediction accuracy and precision as DFT calculations within seconds. Using the developed inverse-design framework, we design 79 new crystals with user-targeted formation energies, 17 crystals with targeted bandgap, and 27 crystals for potential thermoelectric applications. The compositions of those designed materials are unique and cannot be found in the training or test sets. We validate our predictions using first-principle calculations. Toward bridging the gap between simulation and experiment, we demonstrate a naïve synthesizability metric — predicting the existence of an ICSD record — and show this methodology can, in principle, include stability and/or synthesizability as a target metric, once consensus metrics are agreed upon by the field.}

Crystal structure prediction is a necessary step for assessing theoretically the stability of a hypothetical material and, therefore, is a crucial step in inverse materials design protocols. Here, we describe how biologically-inspired global optimization methods can efficiently predict the stable crystal structure of solids. Specifically, we discuss the application of genetic algorithms to search for optimal atom configurations in systems in which the underlying lattice is given, and of evolutionary algorithms to address the general lattice-type prediction problem.}

  abstract = {Radiotherapy is an important clinical tool to fight malignancies. To do so, a key point consists in selecting a suitable radiation dose that could achieve tumour control without inducing significant damage to surrounding healthy tissues. In spite of recent significant advances, any radiotherapy planning in use relies principally on experience-based decisions made by clinicians among several possible choices. In this work we consider a mathematical problem related to that decision-making process. More precisely, we assume that a well-defined target region, called planning target volume (PTV), is given. We then consider the question of determining which radiation distribution is able to achieve a maximum impact on tumour cells and a minimum one in healthy ones. Such dose distribution is defined as the solution of a multi-parameter minimization problem over the PTV and healthy tissues, subject to a number of constraints arising from clinical and technical requirements. For any choice of parameters, sufficient conditions for the existence of a unique solution of that problem are derived. Such solution is then approximated by means of a suitable numerical algorithm. Finally, some examples are considered, on which the dependence on model parameters of different clinical efficiency indexes is discussed.}

Here we investigate and implement two new cost functions frequently used in signal processing community as part of the dose optimization. A simulation model was developed and tested using both phantom data and CT scan results from two patients with encouraging results.},

  abstract = {Radiation therapy concerns the delivery of the proper dose of radiation to a tumor volume without causing irreparable damage to healthy tissue and critical organs. The forward problem refers to calculating the dose distribution that would be delivered to a measured patient cross-section when the radiation field generated by the beam sources is specified. The inverse problem refers to calculating the radiation field that will provide a specified dose distribution in the patient. The forward and inverse problems of radiation-therapy treatment planning are first formulated in their continuous versions, and the point is made that, in this field of application, the inverse problem calls for the inversion of an operator for which no analytic closed-form mathematical representation exists. To attack the inverse problem under such circumstances, a discretized model is set up in which both patient section and radiation field are finely discretized. This leads to a linear feasibility problem, which is solved by a relaxation method. The paper includes full details of this new approach, with discussion of technical aspects such as dose apportionment, software development, and experimental results. Consequences and limitations as well as a precise comparison with other methodologies are also discussed.}

  abstract = {In radiation therapy one is confronted with the task of formulating a treatment plan which delivers a specified dose to a tumour but avoids irreparable damage to surrounding uninvolved structures. Radiation therapy treatment planning (RTTP) involves an inverse and a forward problem. The inverse problem is to devise a treatment plan, i.e. a radiation beam configuration and beam weighting, which provides a specified dose distribution to the delineated region. The forward problem is to calculate the dose distribution within the patient that results from the weighted radiation beam configuration. Since no analytic closed-form mathematical formulation of the forward operator exists, the inverse problem actually calls for computerised inversion of data. This inversion is achieved by constructing a fully discretised model that leads to a system of linear inequalities. These inequalities are solved either by a row-action method or a block-Cimmino algorithm which allows the assignment of weights within each block of inequalities.}

We present a probabilistic model for the IMRT inverse problem and show that it is identical to using robust optimization techniques, under certain assumptions.

  abstract = {AbstractFor some decades radiation therapy - external beam radiation therapy as well as brachytherapy - has been proved successful in cancer treatment. It is the major task of clinical radiation treatment planning to realise on the one hand a high level dose of radiation in the cancer tissue in order to obtain maximum tumour control. On the other hand it is obvious that it is absolutely necessary to keep in the tissue outside the tumour, particularly in organs at risk, the unavoidable radiation as low as possible. No doubt, these two objectives of treatment planning – high level dose in the tumour, low radiation outside the tumour – have a basically contradictory nature. Therefore, it is no surprise that inverse mathematical models with prescribed dose distributions tend to be infeasible in most cases. Thus, there is need for approximations compromising between overdosing the organs at risk and underdosing the target volume. Differing from the currently used time consuming iterative approach, which measures deviation from an ideal (non-achievable) treatment plan using recursively trial-and-error weights for the organs of interest, we go a new way trying to avoid a priori weight choices and consider the treatment planning problem as a multiple objective linear programming problem: with each organ of interest, target tissue as well as organs at risk, we associate an objective function measuring the maximal deviation from the prescribed doses. We build up a data base of relatively few efficient solutions representing and approximating the variety of Pareto solutions of the multiple objective linear programming problem. This data base can be easily scanned by physicians looking for an adequate treatment plan with the aid of an appropriate online tool.},

  abstract = {Abstract Radiotherapy (RT) is among the regular techniques for the treatment of cancerous tumours. Many of cancer patients are treated by this manner. Treatment planning is the most important phase in RT and it plays a key role in therapy quality achievement. As the goal of RT is to irradiate the tumour with adequately high levels of radiation while sparing neighbouring healthy tissues as much as possible, it is a multi-objective problem naturally. In this study, we propose an agent-based model of vascular tumour growth and also effects of RT. Next, we use multi-objective distributed Q-learning algorithm to find Pareto-optimal solutions for calculating RT dynamic dose. We consider multiple objectives and each group of optimizer agents attempt to optimise one of them, iteratively. At the end of each iteration, agents compromise the solutions to shape the Pareto-front of multi-objective problem. We propose a new approach by defining three schemes of treatment planning created based on different combinations of our objectives namely invasive, conservative and moderate. In invasive scheme, we enforce killing cancer cells and pay less attention about irradiation effects on normal cells. In conservative scheme, we take more care of normal cells and try to destroy cancer cells in a less stressed manner. The moderate scheme stands in between. For implementation, each of these schemes is handled by one agent in MDQ-learning algorithm and the Pareto optimal solutions are discovered by the collaboration of agents. By applying this methodology, we could reach Pareto treatment plans through building different scenarios of tumour growth and RT. The proposed multi-objective optimisation algorithm generates robust solutions and finds the best treatment plan for different conditions.}

The probability of accomplishing complication-free tumour control is maximized by an iterative algorithm. The algorithm is demonstrated by applying it to a one-dimensional (1D) tumour model, and also to a more clinically relevant 2D case. The new algorithm is n-dimensional so it could simultaneously optimize the dose delivery in a 3D volume and in principle also select the ideal beam orientations, beam modalities (photons, electrons, neutrons, etc.) and optimal spectral distributions of the corresponding modalities. To make calculation time reasonable, 2D-3D problems are most practical, and suitable beam orientations are preselected by the choice of irradiation kernel. The energy deposition kernel should therefore be selected in order to avoid irradiation through organs at risk. Clinically established dose response parameters for the tissues of interest are used to make the optimization as relevant as possible to the clinical problems at hand.}

  abstract = {Abstract. Radiation therapy planning is often a tight rope walk between dangerous insufficient dose in the target volume and life threatening overdosing of organs at risk. Finding ideal balances between these inherently contradictory goals challenges dosimetrists and physicians in their daily practice. Todays inverse planning systems calculate treatment plans based on a single evaluation function that measures the quality of a radiation treatment plan. Unfortunately, such a one dimensional approach cannot satisfactorily map the different backgrounds of physicians and the patient dependent necessities. So, too often a time consuming iterative optimization process between evaluation of the dose distribution and redefinition of the evaluation function is needed. In this paper we propose a generic multi-criteria approach based on Pareto's solution concept. For each entity of interest – target volume or organ at risk – a structure dependent evaluation function is defined measuring deviations from ideal doses that are calculated from statistical functions. A reasonable bunch of clinically meaningful Pareto optimal solutions are stored in a data base, which can be interactively searched by physicians. The system guarantees dynamic planning as well as the discussion of tradeoffs between different entities. Mathematically, we model the inverse problem as a multi-criteria linear programming problem. Because of the large scale nature of the problem it is not possible to solve the problem in a 3D-setting without adaptive reduction by appropriate approximation schemes. Our approach is twofold: First, the discretization of the continuous problem results from an adaptive hierarchical clustering process which is used for a local refinement of constraints during the optimization procedure. Second, the set of Pareto optimal solutions is approximated by an adaptive grid of representatives that are found by a hybrid process of calculating extreme compromises and interpolation methods.}

This makes it possible to calculate the optimal incident beam profiles required to produce the desired dose distribution in the target volume by solving an integral equation with an iterative algorithm. The major advantage, compared with conventional treatment planning, is that the trial and error part is avoided, and replaced by a deterministic calculation of the optimal treatment plan. In the present paper this algorithm is briefly described and compared with experimental results and an analytical inversion formula which is valid for a cylindrical geometry. The experiments were performed with non-homogeneous beams shaped with compensators designed using the algorithm. The agreement between the experimental results and the predictions of the algorithm are quite good, generally within about 5\%. The differences are caused by discretization noise due to the finite resolution of the calculation matrix, imperfections in the experimental situation, and by the assumption of spatial invariant dose distribution kernels.}

It is shown that the solution generated by the algorithm is the closest possible dose distribution to the desired dose distribution under these constraints. The linear convergence of the rather crude gradient method with fixed-step length is compensated by the fact that fast Fourier transform techniques can be used to speed up the calculations.

METHODS AND MATERIALS An algorithm, based on the inverse technique, has been integrated into the radiotherapy treatment-planning computer system in our Center. This method of computer-assisted treatment design was used to derive intensity-modulated beams to optimize the boost portion of the treatment plan for a patient with a T1c cancer of the prostate. A dose of 72 Gy (in 40 fractions) was given with a six-field plan, and an additional 9 Gy (in five fractions) with six intensity-modulated beams. The intensity-modulated fields were delivered using dynamic multileaf collimation, that is, individual leaves were in motion during radiation delivery, with the treatment machine operating in the clinical mode. Exhaustive quality assurance measurement and monitoring were carried out to ensure safe and accurate implementation. RESULTS Dose distribution and dose-volume histogram of the "inverse method" boost plan and of the composite (72 Gy primary + 9 Gy boost) plan were judged clinically acceptable. Compared to a manually designed boost plan, the inverse treatment design gave improved conformality and increased dose homogeneity in the planning target volume. Film and ion chamber dosimetry, performed prior to the first treatment, indicated that each of the six intensity-modulated fields was accurately produced. Thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) measurements performed on the patient confirmed that the intended dose was delivered in the treatment. In addition, computer-aided treatment-monitoring programs assured that the multileaf collimator (MLC) position file was executed to the specified precision. In terms of the overall radiation treatment process, there will likely be labor savings in the planning and the treatment phases. CONCLUSIONS We have placed into clinical use an integrated system of conformal radiation treatment that incorporated the inverse method of treatment design and the use of dynamic multileaf collimation to deliver intensity-modulated beams. The system can provide better treatment design, which can be implemented reliably and safely. We are hopeful that improved treatment efficacy will result.}

  abstract = {Abstract.Approximately 40\% of all U.S. cancer cases are treated with radiation therapy. In Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) the treatment planning problem is to choose external beam angles and their corresponding intensity maps (showing how the intensity varies across a given beam) to maximize tumor dose subject to the tolerances of surrounding healthy tissues. Dose, like temperature, is a quantity defined at each point in the body, and the distribution of dose is determined by the choice of treatment parameters available to the planner. In addition to absolute dose limits in healthy tissues, some tissues have at least one dose-volume restriction that requires a fraction of its volume to not exceed a specified tighter threshold level for damage. There may also be a homogeneity limit for the tumor that restricts the allowed spread of dose across its volume. We formulate this planning problem as a mixed integer program over a coupled pair of column generation processes – one designed to produce intensity maps, and a second specifying protected area choices for tissues under dose-volume restrictions. The combined procedure is shown to strike a balance between computing an approximately optimal solution and bounding its maximum possible suboptimality that we believe holds promise for implementations able to offer the power and flexibility of mixed-integer linear programming models on instances of practical scale.}

  abstract = {Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) has stirred considerable excitement in the radiation oncology community. Its objective is to make the dose conform to the tumor and spare other organs. Instead of resorting to the rather complex inverse-planning, the technique described here is an extension of the conventional treatment planning technique. The beam orientation and wedge angles are chosen in the conventional rule-based manner. However, within each conformal beam's eye view (BEV) field including margin, a number of sub-field openings are added. The smaller field openings are designed to irradiate the tumor, while sparing the normal tissue of the organs at risk (OARs) that intrude into the target region in the BEV. As the number of intrusions into the target BEV increases, the number of sub-fields for each beam increases. The Cimmino simultaneous projection method was employed to obtain the optimized weighting for each field of each beam. In cases where the dose constraints for the tumor and for the OARs are reasonable, it is possible to obtain a plan with a fairly small number of beams that satisfies the specified dose objectives. This is illustrated for the treatment of prostate cancer, where the rectum creates a concavity in the planning target volume. An advantage of this technique is that the quality assurance for the delivery of these plans does not require extensive special efforts.}

  abstract = {We have developed a new axisymmetric solution for the numerical simulation of single-phase fluid flow in permeable media. In this new solution, the governing parabolic partial differential equation (PDE) is transformed into a linear operator problem that is subsequently solved with an Extended Krylov Subspace Method (EKSM). The algorithm yields solutions for pressure at a multitude of times with the same efficiency of that of a single-time solution. Extensive comparisons with analytical solutions show that our simulator yields pressure results with accuracies better than 1\%, and favorably competes with commercial simulators in CPU execution times and memory efficiency. Examples of numerical simulation are considered for water injection and variable flow-rate problems. In both cases, we have focused our attention to the description of pressure data acquired with permanent sensors deployed in direct hydraulic contact with the producing formation. The inverse problem considered in this paper consists of mapping time and space variations of pressure and flow rate into a local distribution of permeabilities. We solve this inverse problem by minimizing a cost function written as the sum of the square differences between the measured pressure data and the corresponding pressure data yielded by our Krylov subspace simulator. A nonlinear Gauss-Newton fixedpoint iteration search is used to minimize the quadratic cost function. We also test a dual coarseand fine-grid approach to accelerate the solution of the inverse problem. Examples of inversion are shown with noise-free and noisy data aimed at understanding the role played by the flow-rate function and the location, spacing, and number of permanent sensors into the accuracy and stability of the inverted permeability values. Introduction The availability of permanently installed downhole pressure and temperature sensors has opened a new window of opportunities to probe hydrocarbon reservoirs. A continuous stream of time-domain data is now available to perform realtime monitoring of the variation of fluid-flow parameters resulting from production. In turn, time-domain monitoring provides the basic hardware for a much-needed active feedback loop to control hydrocarbon production in real time. Very recently, prototypes of permanent sensors have been constructed to be deployed behind casing and hence to be in direct contact with the producing formations. When commercially available, these in-situ sensors will allow the possibility of delivering real-time images of the spatial distribution of fluid-flow parameters in the vicinity of a well and also between existing wells. Interpretation work is therefore in order to quantify how a variation in the measurements acquired by in-situ permanent sensors will translate into a variation in the spatial distribution of fluidflow properties. It is also imperative to optimally design the spacing and number of permanent sensors in light of existing reservoir conditions and potentially deleterious noisy measurements. The work described in this paper is an attempt to quantify the spatial resolution properties of in-situ permanent pressure measurements. To do so, we consider a hypothetical water injection experiment and make use of the extensive body of estimation techniques available from the field of geophysical inverse theory. Our goal is to construct an efficient algorithm to quantify the sensitivity of permanent pressure data to lateral and vertical variations in the distribution of permeability around the injection well. In the past, several nonlinear optimization procedures have been applied to solve inverse problems in petroleum engineering and ground water hydrology studies. Jacquard and Jain presented the first numerical algorithm for the estimation of two-dimensional (2D) permeability variations from pressure measurements. Later, Carter et al. developed an SPE 71612 Numerical Simulation and Inversion of Pressure Data Acquired With Permanent Sensors Faruk O.

SEPEHRNOORI SPE 71612 efficient method to calculate sensitivity coefficients for 2D single-phase flow. He et al. extended Carter’s method to 3D geometries. Likewise, Chen et al. and Chavent et al. made use of a least-squares formulation based on adjoint operators to compute the gradient of the objective function with respect to the model parameters. In the ground water literature, Carrera and Neuman used an optimal control method to estimate fluid-flow parameters of aquifers. Quite recently, Wu developed an efficient Newton-Raphson nonlinear inversion technique for mapping multiphase production data into distributions of permeability and fluid saturations. The inversion algorithm employed in this paper to evaluate permanent pressure data is based on an efficient least squares minimization technique adapted from the work of TorresVerdín et al.. We also implement a novel dual finitedifference gridding approach to accelerate the inversion associated with a large number of unknown parameters. A Spectral Lanczos Decomposition Method (SLDM) is used to simulate numerically the single-phase pressure data acquired by the permanent sensors. An important feature of the SLDM algorithm is that pressures can be simulated for a multitude of times with almost the same computer efficiency as that of one single time simulation (Knizhnerman et al. and Druskin and Knizhnerman). Our paper concludes with several examples of parametric inversion drawn from the interpretation of pressure, pressure derivative, and flow-rate data acquired with in-situ permanent sensors, and simulated numerically under the assumption of 2D axisymmetric spatial variations of permeability around an injection well.

  abstract = {Inverse identification of complex fluid behaviors is a tricky task because sometimes there are several rheological parameters and the identification procedure itself is quite expensive from the computational time viewpoint. Standard inverse identification procedures solve the model for a choice of the model parameters, and then parameters are updated trying to minimize the gap between the model predictions and some available experimental measures. Thus, the model has to be evaluated for each trial set of the model parameters. When models involve a great number of degrees of freedom the identification procedure becomes a computationally expensive task. In this paper we propose a new procedure able to solve once the model for any value of the model parameters. For this purpose, all the model parameters are considered as extra-coordinates of the model. Thus, the model results finally defined in a multidimensional space including the physical space x, the time t and a number of extra-coordinates related to the model parameters. The solution of such model needs for circumventing the curse of dimensionality illness that suffer multidimensional models.}

  abstract = {In this paper we establish a mathematical framework for a range of inverse problems for functions, given a finite set of noisy observations. The problems are hence underdetermined and are often ill-posed. We study these problems from the viewpoint of Bayesian statistics, with the resulting posterior probability measure being defined on a space of functions. We develop an abstract framework for such problems which facilitates application of an infinite-dimensional version of Bayes theorem, leads to a well-posedness result for the posterior measure (continuity in a suitable probability metric with respect to changes in data), and also leads to a theory for the existence of maximizing the posterior probability (MAP) estimators for such Bayesian inverse problems on function space. A central idea underlying these results is that continuity properties and bounds on the forward model guide the choice of the prior measure for the inverse problem, leading to the desired results on well-posedness and MAP estimators; the PDE analysis and probability theory required are thus clearly dileneated, allowing a straightforward derivation of results. We show that the abstract theory applies to some concrete applications of interest by studying problems arising from data assimilation in fluid mechanics. The objective is to make inference about the underlying velocity field, on the basis of either Eulerian or Lagrangian observations. We study problems without model error, in which case the inference is on the initial condition, and problems with model error in which case the inference is on the initial condition and on the driving noise process or, equivalently, on the entire time-dependent velocity field. In order to undertake a relatively uncluttered mathematical analysis we consider the two-dimensional Navier–Stokes equation on a torus. The case of Eulerian observations—direct observations of the velocity field itself—is then a model for weather forecasting. The case of Lagrangian observations—observations of passive tracers advected by the flow—is then a model for data arising in oceanography. The methodology which we describe herein may be applied to many other inverse problems in which it is of interest to find, given observations, an infinite-dimensional object, such as the initial condition for a PDE. A similar approach might be adopted, for example, to determine an appropriate mathematical setting for the inverse problem of determining an unknown tensor arising in a constitutive law for a PDE, given observations of the solution. The paper is structured so that the abstract theory can be read independently of the particular problems in fluid mechanics which are subsequently studied by application of the theory.}

This inverse design method is based on the exact solution of the local Riemann problem on moving blade surfaces. Furthermore, an improved relaxation factor is added to control the induced velocity for reasonable deformation sizes in different cases. The viscous flow analysis and the inverse design are integrated in the computational fluid dynamics software ANSYS Fluent using the dynamic mesh user-defined function, which reduces the time spent on remeshing the computational domain. A compressor cascade is taken to illustrate the effect of this inverse design method. Using the compressor model, the case of a different loading pattern design under a high subsonic flow regime and the case of a loading smooth design under a transonic flow regime have proved the capability of this inverse design method to realize the prescribed pressure loading distribution.}

We introduce a full discrete linearized scheme that is used to compute the gradient of a given cost function by ensuring its consistency.

The third, estimation of fluid velocities from volumetric dye concentration fields, highlights a previously unexplored connection between fluid simulation and proximal algorithms from convex optimization. This connection allows several classical imaging inverse problems to be investigated in the context of fluids, including optical flow, denoising and deconvolution. The connection also allows inverse problems to be incorporated into fluid simulation for the purposes of physically-based regularization of optical flow and for stylistic modifications of fluid captures. Through both methods and all three applications the importance of incorporating domain-specific priors into inverse problems for fluids and imaging is highlighted.}

The inverse problem was formulated in a nonlinear optimization framework in which model parameters were estimated by minimizing a complex penalty function, representing the discrepancies between the observed and predicted attributes of the physical system. A physical model was designed, built, and operated to collect the experimental datasets needed for model calibration. The proposed strategy was then coupled with the fluid pressure head, fluid content, and fluid flux density time-space series to estimate model parameters. Several optimization scenarios were investigated and it was concluded that while single objective optimization approach has limited accuracy and results in reasonable outputs for one or some attributes of the physical system, the proposed multiobjective optimization shows excellent agreements with the experimental datasets for all state variables.}

The idea is based on the computation of the tissue elasticity distribution. This leads to the inverse elasticity problem; in that, displacement field and boundary conditions are known, and elasticity distribution of the tissue is aimed for computation. We treat this problem by the Gauss–Newton method. This iterative method results in an ill-posed problem, and therefore, regularization schemes are required to deal with this issue. The impacts of the initial guess for tissue elasticity distribution, contrast ratio between elastic modulus of tumor and normal tissue, and noise level of the input data on the estimated solutions are investigated via two different regularization methods. The numerical results show that the accuracy and speed of convergence vary when different regularization methods are applied. Also, the semi-convergence behavior has been observed and discussed. At the end, we signify the necessity of a clever initial guess and intelligent stopping criteria for the iterations. The main purpose here is to highlight some technical factors that have an influence on elasticity image quality and diagnostic accuracy, and we have tried our best to make this article accessible for a broad audience.}

  abstract = {The desire for a diagnostic optical imaging modality has motivated the development of image reconstruction procedures involving solution of the inverse problem. This approach is based on the assumption that, given a set of measurements of transmitted light between pairs of points on the surface of an object, there exists a unique three-dimensional distribution of internal scatterers and absorbers which would yield that set. Thus imaging becomes a task of solving an inverse problem using an appropriate model of photon transport. In this paper we examine the models that have been developed for this task, and review current approaches to image reconstruction. Specifically, we consider models based on radiative transfer theory and its derivatives, which are either stochastic in nature (random walk, Monte Carlo, and Markov processes) or deterministic (partial differential equation models and their solutions). Image reconstruction algorithms are discussed which are based on either direct backprojection, perturbation methods, nonlinear optimization, or Jacobian calculation. Finally we discuss some of the fundamental problems that must be addressed before optical tomography can be considered to be an understood problem, and before its full potential can be realized.}

  abstract = {Since its beginning almost eight decades ago, diagnostic radiology has been con cerned with two main objectives. One is how to determine the three-dimensional anatomy from two or more projections, and the other is to depict organs and struc tures that cannot usually be seen in the films, except by various artificial means. The large part of the very extensive methodology used in diagnostic radiology is devoted to solving these two problems. The spatial reconstruction of the anatomy is usually made intuitively by the radiologist who, by 'three-dimensional thinking', combines two or more images into a spatial concept of the organ under examination. There are many methods designed to aid this reconstruction or to carry it out automatically. Stereo vision may achieve a partially spatial reconstruction, using two projections and possibly special instruments. Conventional tomography is a method that performs a recon struction of a certain layer of the patient, but the reconstruction is incomplete. The inability of conventional diagnostic radiology to discriminate between more than four different materials in the body, namely air, fat, soft tissues, and bones or calcifications, led to the development of a number of contrast media, as well as a large number of ingenious methods of introducing these media into all possible cavities, tubes and vessels in the body in order to decipt them. Certain organs and certain pathologic processes having a different vascularity than the sur rounding tissues and organs, may be demonstrated by angiography. However, this cannot be regarded as a true delineation of the organ itself, but only of its vessels.},

  abstract = {Dynamic medical imaging problems are typically structured as "partial" inverse problems: the desired time series of images (a spatiotemporal matrix) is subject to a purely spatial transformation (its product with a transfer matrix) - so that the forward operator does not address all of the variables of the function to be transformed (analogous to partial differentiation, which is also a partial inverse problem). Given that the transfer matrix is ill-conditioned, the problem of providing the image sequence requires regularization. Under rather general conditions applicable to the setting of partial inverse problems, the regularization parameter of Tikhonov regularization generalizes to a regularization parameter operator, which in proper combination with a standard (spatial) Tikhonov regularizing operator describes the minimum-mean-square-error estimate analogously to that of the Bayesian interpretation of Tikhonov regularization as applied to a "complete" inverse problem. This is in distinction to usual methodology employed for dynamic imaging problems, including usual applications of Tikhonov regularization in this realm, which cannot similarly supply the minimum-mean-square-estimate (under the stated general conditions). The potential power of the implied methodology is illustrated with a numerical example - indicating that substantial improvements in solution estimation are possible.},

  abstract = {Taming unstable inverse problems François Monard This thesis explores two mathematical routes that make the transition from some severely illposed parameter reconstruction problems to better-posed versions of them. The general introduction starts by defining what we mean by an inverse problem and its theoretical analysis. We then provide motivations that come from the field of medical imaging. The first part consists in the analysis of an inverse problem involving the Boltzmann transport equation, with applications in Optical Tomography. There we investigate the reconstruction of the spatially-dependent part of the scattering kernel, from knowledge of angularly averaged outgoing traces of transport solutions and isotropic boundary sources. We study this problem in the stationary regime first, then in the time-harmonic regime. In particular we show, using techniques from functional analysis and stationary phase, that this inverse problem is severely ill-posed in the former setting, whereas it is mildly ill-posed in the latter. In this case, we deduce that making the measurements depend on modulation frequency allows to improve the stability of reconstructions. In the second part, we investigate the inverse problem of reconstructing a tensor-valued conductivity (or diffusion) coefficient in a second-order elliptic partial differential equation, from knowledge of internal measurements of power density type. This problem finds applications in the medical imaging modalities of Electrical Impedance Tomography and Optical Tomography, and the fact that one considers power densities is justified in practice by assuming a coupling of this physical model with ultrasound waves, a coupling assumption that is characteristic of so-called hybrid medical imaging methods. Starting from the famous Caldeŕon’s problem (i.e. the same parameter reconstruction problem from knowledge of boundary fluxes of solutions), and recalling its lack of injectivity and severe instability, we show how going from Dirichletto-Neumann data to considering the power density operator leads to reconstruction of the full conductivity tensor via explicit inversion formulas. Moreover, such reconstruction algorithms only require the loss of either zero or one derivative from the power density functionals to the unknown, depending on what part of the tensor one wants to reconstruct. The inversion formulas are worked out with the help of linear algebra and differential geometry, in particular calculus with the Euclidean connection. The practical pay-off of such theoretical improvements in injectivity and stability is twofold: (i) the lack of injectivity of Calderón’s problem, no longer existing when using power density measurements, implies that future medical imaging modalities such as hybrid methods may make anisotropic properties of human tissues more accessible; (ii) the improvements in stability for both problems in transport and conductivity may yield practical improvements in the resolution of images of the reconstructed coefficients.}

We hope that this classification will guide the curious reader into a discipline with a rich bibliography and sometimes sophisticated mathematics.

The following biomedical imaging modalities are studied: electro/magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG), electrical impedance tomography (EIT), and limited-angle computerized tomography (limited-angle CT). The use of a priori information about the unknown feature is necessary for finding an adequate answer to an inverse problem. Both classical regularization techniques and Bayesian methodology are applied to utilize the a priori knowledge. The inverse problems specifically considered in this work include determination of relatively small electric conductivity anomalies in EIT, dipole-like sources in EEG/MEG, and multiscale X-ray absorbing structures in limited-angle CT. Computational methods and techniques applied for solving these have been designed case-by-case. Results concern, among others, appropriate parametrization of inverse problems; two-stage reconstruction processes, in which a region of interest (ROI) is determined in the first stage and the actual reconstruction is found in the second stage; effective forward simulation through hand pversions of the finite element method (FEM); localization of dipole-like electric sources through hierarchical Bayesian models; implementation of the Kirsch factorization method for reconstruction of conductivity anomalies; as well as the use of a coarse-to-fine reconstruction strategy in linear inverse problems.

In this work, we address the following question:\textbackslash textitGiven a set of measurements obtained from real imaging experiments, what is the best way to use a learnable model and the physics of the modality to solve the inverse problem and reconstruct the latent image?  Standard supervised learning based methods approach this problem by collecting data sets of known latent images and their corresponding measurements. However, these methods are often impractical due to the lack of availability of appropriately sized training sets, and, more generally, due to the inherent difficulty in measuring the "groundtruth" latent image. In light of this, we propose a self-supervised approach to training inverse models in medical imaging in the absence of aligned data. Our method only requiring access to the measurements and the forward model at training. We showcase its effectiveness on inverse problems arising in accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).}

  abstract = {Reconstructing medical images from partial measurements is an important inverse problem in Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Existing solutions based on machine learning typically train a model to directly map measurements to medical images, leveraging a training dataset of paired images and measurements. These measurements are typically synthesized from images using a fixed physical model of the measurement process, which hinders the generalization capability of models to unknown measurement processes. To address this issue, we propose a fully unsupervised technique for inverse problem solving, leveraging the recently introduced score-based generative models. Specifically, we first train a score-based generative model on medical images to capture their prior distribution. Given measurements and a physical model of the measurement process at test time, we introduce a sampling method to reconstruct an image consistent with both the prior and the observed measurements. Our method does not assume a fixed measurement process during training, and can thus be flexibly adapted to different measurement processes at test time. Empirically, we observe comparable or better performance to supervised learning techniques in several medical imaging tasks in CT and MRI, while demonstrating significantly better generalization to unknown measurement processes.},

  abstract = {To make practical the molecular dynamics simulation of large scale reactive chemical systems (1000s of atoms), we developed ReaxFF, a force field for reactive systems. ReaxFF uses a general relationship between bond distance and bond order on one hand and between bond order and bond energy on the other hand that leads to proper dissociation of bonds to separated atoms. Other valence terms present in the force field (angle and torsion) are defined in terms of the same bond orders so that all these terms go to zero smoothly as bonds break. In addition, ReaxFF has Coulomb and Morse (van der Waals) potentials to describe nonbond interactions between all atoms (no exclusions). These nonbond interactions are shielded at short range so that the Coulomb and van der Waals interactions become constant as Rij → 0. We report here the ReaxFF for hydrocarbons. The parameters were derived from quantum chemical calculations on bond dissociation and reactions of small molecules plus heat of formation and geometry data for a number of stable hydrocarbon compounds. We find that the ReaxFF provides a good description of these data. Generally, the results are of an accuracy similar or better than PM3, while ReaxFF is about 100 times faster. In turn, the PM3 is about 100 times faster than the QC calculations. Thus, with ReaxFF we hope to be able to study complex reactions in hydrocarbons.},

    abstract = { The first step in the construction of a regression model or a data-driven analysis, aiming to predict or elucidate the relationship between the atomic-scale structure of matter and its properties, involves transforming the Cartesian coordinates of the atoms into a suitable representation. The development of atomic-scale representations has played, and continues to play, a central role in the success of machine-learning methods for chemistry and materials science. This review summarizes the current understanding of the nature and characteristics of the most commonly used structural and chemical descriptions of atomistic structures, highlighting the deep underlying connections between different frameworks and the ideas that lead to computationally efficient and universally applicable models. It emphasizes the link between properties, structures, their physical chemistry, and their mathematical description, provides examples of recent applications to a diverse set of chemical and materials science problems, and outlines the open questions and the most promising research directions in the field. }

We show evidence, from an examination of the distribution of pairwise distances between frames, that some features of the free-energy surface are inherently high-dimensional. This makes dimensionality reduction problematic because the data does not satisfy the assumptions made in conventional manifold learning algorithms We therefore propose that when dimensionality reduction is performed on trajectory data one should think of the resultant embedding as a quickly sketched set of directions rather than a road map. In other words, the embedding tells one about the connectivity between states but does not provide the vectors that correspond to the slow degrees of freedom. This realization informs the development of sketch-map, which endeavors to reproduce the proximity information from the high-dimensionality description in a space of lower dimensionality even when a faithful embedding is not possible.}}

In this paper,we put forward a framework combining feature engineering and linear regression to find the correlation between structure and properties from materials data. High temperature superconductor and double perovskites for solar cells were employed to test the feasibility of the method. In the former, we successfully rebuilt a descriptor (l\zeta{})\textminus{}1 from data mining which is consistent with the theoretical formula. In the latter, as an exploration, we obtain a new descriptor \chi{} b 2 rs x 2 e rs x \textminus{} 1 from data mining which expresses the heat of formation (\Delta{}HF) in the double perovskite. By our experiment, the method can obtain related expressions of structure-property relationship for material.The results show that the method is a simple yet efficient paradigm to construct the structure-property relationship and provides valuable hints to accelerate the process of materials design.},

Most of this work relies on defining clever feature representations, in which the chemical graph structure is encoded in a uniform way such that predictions across chemical space can be made. In this work, we propose to exploit the powerful ability of deep neural networks to learn a feature representation from low-level encodings of a huge corpus of chemical structures. Our model borrows ideas from neural machine translation: it translates between two semantically equivalent but syntactically different representations of molecular structures, compressing the meaningful information both representations have in common in a low-dimensional representation vector. Once the model is trained, this representation can be extracted for any new molecule and utilized as descriptor. In fair benchmarks with respect to various human-engineered molecular fingerprints and graph-convolution models, our method shows competitive performance in modelling quantitative structure-activity relationships in all analyzed datasets. Additionally, we show that our descriptor significantly outperforms all baseline molecular fingerprints in two ligand-based virtual screening tasks. Overall, our descriptors show the most consistent performances over all experiments. The continuity of the descriptor space and the existence of the decoder that permits to deduce a chemical structure from an embedding vector allows for exploration of the space and opens up new opportunities for compound optimization and idea generation.},

Molecular descriptors and fingerprints have been routinely used in QSAR/SAR analysis, virtual drug screening, compound search/ranking, drug ADME/T prediction and other drug discovery processes. Since the calculation of such quantitative representations of molecules may require substantial computational skills and efforts, several tools have been previously developed to make an attempt to ease the process. However, there are still several hurdles for users to overcome to fully harness the power of these tools. First, most of the tools are distributed as standalone software or packages that require necessary configuration or programming efforts of users. Second, many of the tools can only calculate a subset of molecular descriptors, and the results from multiple tools need to be manually merged to generate a comprehensive set of descriptors. Third, some packages only provide application programming interfaces and are implemented in different computer languages, which pose additional challenges to the integration of these tools.Results

A freely available web-based platform, named ChemDes, is developed in this study. It integrates multiple state-of-the-art packages (i.e., Pybel, CDK, RDKit, BlueDesc, Chemopy, PaDEL and jCompoundMapper) for computing molecular descriptors and fingerprints. ChemDes not only provides friendly web interfaces to relieve users from burdensome programming work, but also offers three useful and convenient auxiliary tools for format converting, MOPAC optimization and fingerprint similarity calculation. Currently, ChemDes has the capability of computing 3679 molecular descriptors and 59 types of molecular fingerprints.ConclusionChemDes provides users an integrated and friendly tool to calculate various molecular descriptors and fingerprints. It is freely available at http://www.scbdd.com/chemdes. The source code of the project is also available as a supplementary file.},

We describe a new type of descriptor of this type, the charge fingerprint. This descriptor family can build good QSAR models of a diverse range of physicochemical and biological properties and can be calculated quickly and easily. It appears to be useful for modeling large data sets and has potential for screening large virtual libraries.},

The ‘atomic body-ordered permutation-invariant polynomials’ comprise a systematic basis and are constructed to preserve the symmetry of the potential energy function with respect to rotations and permutations. In contrast to kernel based and artificial neural network models, the explicit decomposition of the total energy as a sum of atomic body-ordered terms allows to keep the dimensionality of the fit reasonably low, up to just 10 for the 5-body terms. The explainability of the potential is aided by this decomposition, as the low body-order components can be studied and interpreted independently. Moreover, although polynomial basis functions are thought to extrapolate poorly, we show that the low dimensionality combined with careful regularisation actually leads to better transferability than the high dimensional, kernel based Gaussian Approximation Potential.}

              Background
              There are two line notations of chemical structures that have established themselves in the field: the SMILES string and the InChI string. The InChI aims to provide a unique, or canonical, identifier for chemical structures, while SMILES strings are widely used for storage and interchange of chemical structures, but no standard exists to generate a canonical SMILES string.
            
            
              Results
              I describe how to use the InChI canonicalisation to derive a canonical SMILES string in a straightforward way, either incorporating the InChI normalisations (Inchified SMILES) or not (Universal SMILES). This is the first description of a method to generate canonical SMILES that takes stereochemistry into account. When tested on the 1.1 m compounds in the ChEMBL database, and a 1 m compound subset of the PubChem Substance database, no canonicalisation failures were found with Inchified SMILES. Using Universal SMILES, 99.79\% of the ChEMBL database was canonicalised successfully and 99.77\% of the PubChem subset.
            
            
              Conclusions
              The InChI canonicalisation algorithm can successfully be used as the basis for a common standard for canonical SMILES. While challenges remain – such as the development of a standard aromatic model for SMILES – the ability to create the same SMILES using different toolkits will mean that for the first time it will be possible to easily compare the chemical models used by different toolkits.},

However, their rational design is not well established, and currently less than 6,000 experimentally synthesized 2D materials have been reported. Recently, deep learning, data-mining, and density functional theory (DFT)-based high-throughput calculations are widely performed to discover potential new materials for diverse applications. Here we propose a generative material design pipeline, namely material transformer generator(MTG), for large-scale discovery of hypothetical 2D materials. We train two 2D materials composition generators using self-learning neural language models based on Transformers with and without transfer learning. The models are then used to generate a large number of candidate 2D compositions, which are fed to known 2D materials templates for crystal structure prediction. Next, we performed DFT computations to study their thermodynamic stability based on energy-above-hull and formation energy. We report four new DFT-verified stable 2D materials with zero e-above-hull energies, including NiCl\$\_4\$, IrSBr, CuBr\$\_3\$, and CoBrCl. Our work thus demonstrates the potential of our MTG generative materials design pipeline in the discovery of novel 2D materials and other functional materials.},

  abstract = {Hydrogen economy, wherein hydrogen is used as the fuel in the transport and energy sectors, holds significant promise in mitigating the deleterious effects of global warming. Photocatalytic water splitting using sunlight is perhaps the cleanest way of producing the hydrogen fuel. Among various other factors, widespread adoption of this technology has mainly been stymied by the lack of a catalyst material with high efficiency. 2D materials have shown significant promise as efficient photocatalysts for water splitting. The availability of open databases containing the “computed” properties of 2D materials and advancements in deep learning now enable us to do “inverse” design of these 2D photocatalysts for water splitting. We use one such database (Jain et al., ACS Energ. Lett. 2019, 4, 6, 1410–1411) to build a generative model for the discovery of novel 2D photocatalysts. The structures of the materials were converted into a 3D image–based representation that was used to train a cell, a basis autoencoder and a segmentation network to ascertain the lattice parameters as well as position of atoms from the images. Subsequently, the cell and basis encodings were used to train a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) to learn a continuous representation of the materials in a latent space. The latent space of the CVAE was then sampled to generate several new 2D materials that were likely to be efficient photocatalysts for water splitting. The bandgap of the generated materials was predicted using a graph neural network model while the band edge positions were obtained via empirical correlations. Although our generative modeling framework was used to discover novel 2D photocatalysts for water splitting reaction, it is generic in nature and can be used directly to discover novel materials for other applications as well.},

In this paper, we introduce the Materials Project (www.materialsproject.org), a core program of the Materials Genome Initiative that uses high-throughput computing to uncover the properties of all known inorganic materials. This open dataset can be accessed through multiple channels for both interactive exploration and data mining. The Materials Project also seeks to create open-source platforms for developing robust, sophisticated materials analyses. Future efforts will enable users to perform ‘‘rapid-prototyping’’ of new materials in silico, and provide researchers with new avenues for cost-effective, data-driven materials design.},

While these simulations provide high-fidelity models, they are poorly suited for inference and lead to challenging inverse problems. We review the rapidly developing field of simulation-based inference and identify the forces giving additional momentum to the field. Finally, we describe how the frontier is expanding so that a broad audience can appreciate the profound influence these developments may have on science.},
