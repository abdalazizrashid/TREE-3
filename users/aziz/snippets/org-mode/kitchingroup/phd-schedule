Understanding what has been done in the literature, and how to cite it in technical writing is an important skill. You should perform a literature search relevant to your project, and prepare a summary document of what you find. This document should cover 5-10 papers/books with a paragraph on each reference that briefly summarizes the reference. Make sure to create a bibtex file with the references in them, and use cite links in this document.

See elisp:org-ref-help for some help on citations and references.

You should prepare a written document that outlines your plans for your project and what you want to accomplish in the spring semester.

This is your opportunity to articulate in words your understanding of what we are trying to do, and to begin organizing and prioritizing your thoughts on the project. This document does not need to be long, but it needs to be helpful.
