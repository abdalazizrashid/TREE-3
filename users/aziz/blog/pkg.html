Avy is a great package that among other things helps you jump to a

isearch (both built in) are good ways to jump further in the buffer,

<p>
When you focus on what you are trying to learn, solve, or understand,
your mind is in a focused thinking mode. This is how you collect
initial knowledge, make decisions, address problems, and direct
attention and memory. If you're trying to solve an out-of-the-box
problem, however, you don't yet have an established pathway. When this
is the case, you need a wider and unrestricted mental space. Diffuse
thinking allows you to achieve just that. This mode is switched on
when your brain is in a rest state. It can be achieved through
pleasant, joyful, or calming activities. Unlike focused thinking,
diffuse thinking has little to do with the activation of specific
brain areas. It's kind of "scattered" around. This type of cognitive
process is especially important for originality and critical thinking
as it allows us to experience sudden insights and find bright
solutions.

René Descartes (1596-1650), Mathematician
</p>

<p>
There are several legends about how the coordinate system, named after
René Descartes, was invented. One of them features a fly. It is
believed that Descartes was inspired by observing a fly buzz
around. The polymath wanted to come up with a mathematical means of
describing the position of the fly at any given moment in time so he
could swat it. Eventually, he formulated the Cartesian plane, one of
the greatest inventions of humankind. This method allows you to
identify the location of an object in 3D space and in 2D planes.

<p>
Igor Kurchatov (1903-1960), Physicist
</p>

<p>
Balancing focused work and recreation is the secret to good health, as
well as effective problem-solving. Einstein enjoyed cycling as a
pastime. Academic Kolmogorov could not imagine his life without
skiing. Igor Kurchatov could always find a spare minute for his
favorite game, ping-pong, even when he was leading the USSR's atomic
program and presided over the Institute of Atomic Energy. He also
encouraged his colleagues to join in. Kurchatov would often announce a
ping-pong break in the middle of the day. If, like Kurchatov, you are
tempted to take a break, you can walk to the sports area of this
pavilion. Alternatively, to get there you can take a shortcut through
the pipe, or the "wormhole." It might not transport you to another
world or galaxy (unlike true wormholes, which sparked multiple
discussions after Einstein's theory of relativity was
published). Nonetheless, the pipe will save you a few minutes and can
be a first-person experience of traveling through a tunnel that bends
some space and a little time, while a true wormhole is yet to be found
or created.

<p>
Archimedes (287-212 BC), Scientist
</p>

<p>
"Eureka!" ("I got it!") exclaimed Archimedes, the most famous
mathematician and inventor in ancient Greece, when he discovered the
principle of displacement. The legend says that the king asked
Archimedes to find out whether his crown was pure gold without
damaging it. While it was easy to weigh the crown, to calculate the
density of the metal (gold has high density) he first needed to find
its volume. So, Archimedes, preoccupied with his thoughts, plunged
into the bathtub, and immediately saw the water level rise. At this
point, the scientist realized that the volume of his body had
displaced an equal volume of water. Therefore, a crown, lowered into a
basin filled to the brim, would displace a volume of water equal to
its own volume. Archimedes figured out how to solve the problem, and
at the same time discovered the basic law of hydrostatics, named in
his honor, which states: any object, totally or partially immersed in
a fluid, is buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the fluid
displaced by the object.

<p>
Boris Egorov (1913-1976), Mechanic
</p>

<p>
In the early 1950s, the first computers (calculating and analytical
machines) appeared in the USSR. Inside they had small 2mm rings of
superfine wire that was thinner than a hair. The wire, encased in a
fragile membrane, had to be continuously pulled through a pinhole. A
winder at the factory could complete no more than 30 rings per shift,
whereas a computer required thousands. Boris Egorov was a mechanic but
spent most of his spare time engineering and making prototypes. For
many months he tried to understand how to get a tiny bobbin to slide
more easily through the ring. One day on the train, he saw an old lady
crocheting. As he watched her hand move, the revelation came to
him. All he needed was a hook and a similar thread motion. This
observation was the basis for the invention of the legendary Egorov's
winding machine which automated the process and increased labor
productivity by 8000 times.

Gavril Ilizarov (1921-1992), Physician
</p>

<p>
One day, a young surgeon Gavriil Ilizarov was riding a horse-drawn
cart. His mind was focused on finding a solution that would help
patients with complex bone fractures recover quicker. At the time, the
procedure required bed rest while wearing a cast for a total of 2 or 3
months. Ilizarov's eyes fell on a horse harness. Without touching the
animal's neck, it provided rigid fixation of the shaft with a yoke and
an arc. It occurred to Ilizarov that he could make a similar support
for his patients. He ran into the barn, broke the shovel handle, and
fixed it with a mechanism he had just envisioned. The handle remained
straight, as if it had not been broken. This is how the Ilizarov
apparatus was invented. The apparatus is composed of rings that are
affixed to healthy bone with wires and pins, held in place with
additional rods. This unique design allows physicians to fix the
fractured bone at different angles, as well as to compress or stretch
the bone tissue. At the same time, no bed rest is necessary, which
positively affects the metabolic processes and accelerates
healing. This was truly a revolutionary concept in orthopedic surgery.

<p>
Hungarian journalist Laszlo Josef Biro, the creator of the ballpoint

tried to perfect the ink for fountain pens but later realized that he
actually needed to create a whole new pen. It is said that the first
prototype of the modern ballpoint pen came about after Laszlo Biro
dreamt of hooligans interrupting his work. Enraged, the inventor
grabbed a gun loaded with ink; however, its muzzle was blocked with a
small ball. The barrel of the new pen was essentially a tube with a
freely rotating ball at the end. This invention was patented in 1938
and named "biro" in honor of Laszlo.

Frederick Grant Banting (1891-1941), Medical Scientist
</p>

<p>
After losing a close friend to diabetes, Canadian scientist Frederick
Grant Banting dedicated his life to finding a cure for this dreaded
disease which causes spikes in blood sugar levels and wreaks havoc on
the body. Banting started by reviewing the existing literature. One
evening, while reading an article about the link between diabetes and
the pancreas, he fell asleep. In his dream, Banting figured out how to
obtain the hormone insulin from the pancreas of a healthy dog and then
transfer it to a dog with diabetes. Waking up in the middle of the
night, he wrote down the methodology for a medical experiment he had
never even thought of before and very soon put it into practice. The
results of the experiment were astonishing: the level of glucose in
the animal's blood dropped by 40%, and the dog's condition visibly
improved. Thus, Frederick Banting learned how to obtain insulin,
which, being the main treatment for diabetes, continues to save lives
every day. In recognition of his scientific achievement, 32-year-old
Frederick Banting was awarded the Nobel Prize, thus becoming the
youngest Nobel Prize winner in physiology or medicine.

Elias Howe (1819-1867), Mechanic
</p>

<p>
It was 1844. American inventor Elias Howe was working on a prototype
for the first sewing machine. However, the eye of the needle proved to
be a challenge. The design caused the needle to get stuck in the
fabric and the thread to get tangled up. Other inventors experienced
the same problem, only ever finding impractical solutions, either too
elaborate or too time-consuming. They slowed down the snail's pace of
machine sewing even more. One night Howe had a nightmare. He was
captured by a tribe of cannibals who took him prisoner and threatened
to kill him unless he finished his sewing machine right there and
then. Fearing for his life, Howe looked around at the spears pointed
at him and noticed a peculiar eye-shaped hole on the spear tip. He
found it! What he needed was an eye close to the point of the needle!
In the morning, the mechanic made a quick sketch of the
mechanism. Since then, this type of needle is used in all sewing
machines.

By his own admission, German chemist August Kekule spent many years

tormented the scientist so much that he could not stop thinking about
it. He even had a recurring dream that he had already succeeded only
to find out in the morning that it was merely a reflection of the
thoughts that occupied his every waking hour. It was only on a cold
night in 1865 when Kekule fell asleep sitting next to the fireplace
that he had this peculiar vision: "In front of my eyes, atoms were
twinning and twisting in snakelike motion. But look! What was that?
One of the snakes had seized hold of its tail, and the form whirled
mockingly before my eyes. As if by a flash of lightning, I awoke; and
this time I also spent the rest of the night working out the
consequences of the hypothesis." This was a truly revolutionary
discovery at the time. Kekule was so astounded by the dream that he
shared it at the next scientific congress and urged colleagues to pay
more attention to their own visions.

Italian artist, scientist, and inventor Leonardo da Vinci had his own
technique: he used to alternate focused work with contemplation or
sleep. He was able to observe the natural world in a way other people
could not and could base his discoveries on seemingly commonplace
phenomena. Time management, which gained popularity in the 20th
century, had already been used by Leonardo as far back as the 16th
century. Every observation led to a discovery: he studied the human
body and invented a robot; he watched the birds in the sky and
designed a flying machine. This cozy area invites you to enjoy mindful
contemplation like Leonardo. To feel like a bird, you don't have to
learn how to fly: a comfortable nest and a little imagination can give
you a similar experience. Perhaps later you will find a new creative
solution to a long-term problem. Especially if you, like Leonardo,
manage to take that 20-minute nap which could bring you to the very

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org76e7090">
<p>
In the 1980s, Francesco Cirillo, an Italian student, had difficulties
focusing on his studies. To avoid distractions, he set a tomato-shaped
kitchen timer and arranged a self-study schedule with breaks taken
when the timer rang. Francesco did not yet know that he had invented a
new time management method, Pomodoro (Italian for "tomato"), which is
becoming increasingly popular today. The Pomodoro technique involves 2
simple stages: setting a timer for 25 minutes to work and taking a
5-minute break after the timer rings. Longer breaks are taken after
four consecutive work intervals. Alternating between work and rest
cycles boosts your productivity. The timer also allows you to
concentrate on the task at hand without getting up for a cup of coffee
or checking social media. Regular breaks help your mind rest and
switch off. The technique does not only improve your productivity but
also helps to regain your creative strength, as fixed break sessions
are the key to getting into the flow.

Joseph John Thomson (1856-1940), Physicist
</p>

<p>
Epiphanies come to those who think abstractly. They notice unrelated
phenomena, yet are able to connect the dots; they observe familiar
objects, yet see something new in them. They can integrate extensive
knowledge and find solutions by looking at their environment through a
creative lens. Who knows, perhaps it was during lunchtime (a great
time for a pudding) when physicist Joseph Thomson supposed that an
atom is in fact similar to a British plum pudding which was popular
with his compatriots at that time. The dessert was enjoyed by many,
but it was Thomson who compared electrons to negatively charged
"plums" in a positively charged cloud - the pudding. Although
Thomson's theory was disproved, it was thanks to this model that he
could prove experimentally that an atom can be split. Thomson
shattered the long-held notion that an atom is fundamental and
indivisible. Simultaneously, he managed to explain Mendeleev's
periodic table through the language of physics: his "plum pudding"
described chemical reactions. In Thompson's own words: "As we conquer
peak after peak, we do not see the horizon; in the distance tower
still higher peaks, which will yield to those who ascend them still
wider prospects." Immerse yourself in the exciting world of
discoveries led by scientists who carefully observed the universe
